322	Beat the heat with a bowl of gazpacho	42	beat-heat-bowl-gazpacho	680		Gazpacho, or cold tomato soup, is an easy-to-make recipe that’s perfect for the summer. Although the dish originated in Spain, there are slight variations of the recipe in countries around the world.\r\n\r\nI decided to go with a quick and easy version of the recipe. It requires minimal ingredients that are  cheap to purchase at any grocery store.  The necessary cooking materials are present in most student kitchens.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ingredients</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>6 plum tomatoes, chopped</li>\r\n\r\n<li>4 green onions, chopped</li>\r\n\r\n<li>1/2 large cucumber, peeled and chopped</li>\r\n\r\n<li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>\r\n\r\n<li>1/2 cup water</li>\r\n\r\n<li>2 tablespoons vinegar</li>\r\n\r\n<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>\r\n\r\n<li>salt and pepper to taste</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gazpacho2"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\n\r\nDirections</strong>\r\n\r\nCombine the tomatoes, green onions, cucumber, bell pepper and water in a blender; blend until smooth. Add the vinegar and olive oil; blend again until well mixed. Season with salt and pepper to serve.\r\n\r\nPreparation time: 15 to 20 minutes\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gazpacho1"-->\r\n\r\nMy biggest challenge making gazpacho was making sure that everything fit into my food processor without spilling over. Overall, this recipe is not all that difficult to make, which means it’s perfect for any student who’s tight on money and time. Plus, it’s also healthy and refreshing.\r\n\r\nAs delicious as gazpacho is, be forewarned—it’s not very filling. Some recipes recommend dipping bread or tortilla chips in it, which would make it a simple and satisfying snack on a hot summer day. Try it the next time you’re looking for something delicious during a heat wave, or if you find there’s an unexpected abundance of tomatoes.\r\n\r\n<em>Source: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quick-and-fresh-gazpacho/detail.aspx </em></em>	t	t	2011-08-05 18:26:51-04	2011-08-05 17:49:18-04	2011-08-05 17:49:18-04	t
321	Fad diets and weight-loss myths	41	fad-diets-and-weight-loss-myths	528		When it comes to losing weight, there seems to be a focus on upheaving daily diet routine in exchange for instant results. The summer season seems like the perfect time to experiment, but before you clear your fridge of bread, beware that some major diet fads are based on fiction and can even inhibit proper nutrition.\r\n\r\nI spoke to Queen’s Peer Health Outreach Coordinator Beth Doxsee to get the skinny on how five major diet trends affect the maintenance of a healthy diet.\r\n\r\n<strong>Eating every three hours</strong>\r\n\r\nThis trend encourages people to eat every three hours to keep their metabolism constantly at work, thus effectively burning calories at all times. According to Doxsee, there is value to this trend because when ravenous, people don’t always make the wisest food choices.\r\n\r\n“Grabbing a simple sugar, such as a granola bar or cookie, will cause your energy levels to peak and then crash,” she said.\r\n\r\nEating snacks throughout the day will prevent your hunger from overwhelming you.\r\n\r\n“You have to be careful to watch your portion sizes and be careful of what you’re eating,” Doxsee said, adding that an ideal snack would include a complex carb, a fruit or vegetable and a source of protein. Each breaks down at a different rate, providing lasting energy and preventing hunger from setting in before mealtime.\r\n\r\n<strong>Stop eating at 7 p.m.</strong>\r\n\r\nMany people believe that after 7 p.m. your metabolism ceases to burn calories effectively. According to Doxsee, this is a total myth. Some people may be encouraged to stop eating at 7 p.m. because at night time, snacking happens for the wrong reasons like tiredness or boredom.  \r\n\r\n“Since students have such irregular schedules that see them up at all hours of the night, waking up late in the day or playing intramural games at 10 p.m., they need to fuel their bodies when they need to, even if it is late at night,” she said.\r\n<strong>\r\nFasting or cleansing to jumpstart weight-loss</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are many things wrong with these diets, Doxsee said.\r\n\r\n“When you fast, you are putting your body into starvation mode,” she said, adding that your metabolism will slow down because your body doesn’t know when it will get food again.\r\n\r\n“You may see initial weight loss, but your metabolic rate will stay low even once you start eating again.” \r\n\r\nAlso, denying yourself the calories you need prevents your whole body from carrying out its basic tasks. \r\n\r\n“Your body and brain are constantly at work in some way. Your body needs calories to function properly,” Doxsee said.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, there are more effective ways to rid the body of toxins and speed up metabolisms, such as exercising.\r\n\r\n<strong>Eating a low-fat diet\t</strong>\r\n\r\nMany people follow a low-fat diet plan believing that if you consume fat, it will be stored as fat. Doxsee said this isn’t necessarily true and fats are essential to a healthy diet.\r\n\r\n“We need fat to transport vitamins and nutrients,” she said, adding that it’s actually not about what you eat, but how much.  “No matter what you consume, be it fat or something else, you will store fat and put on weight if you take in more calories daily than you need.”\r\n\r\nShe said low-fat versions of foods are often more processed and artificial, which isn’t good for our bodies. One key factor is distinguishing between saturated and unsaturated fats.  The intake of saturated fats, found in red meat and products such as butter and cheese needs to be limited while  unsaturated fats, found in nuts, seafood and avocado are generally healthy.  \r\n\r\n<strong>Eating a low-carb diet</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Atkins diet made low-carb diets a popular, advising that carbohydrates be avoided so that bodies burn fat instead of carbohydrates. About 55 to 60 per cent of your daily caloric intake should come from carbs, Doxsee said.\r\n\r\n“Carbohydrates are our brain food. You may see initial weight loss by cutting carbs, but there are negative side effects that may include headaches or loss of concentration."\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates store more water than other macronutrients, which is why you may feel more bloated after eating them. However, our bodies need water and carbs actually help with hydration.\r\n\r\nSome low-carb diets even go so far as discouraging certain fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamins, minerals and fibres that shouldn’t be left out of any diet.\r\n\r\nDoxsee said it’s important to warn students against stressing or obsessing over their diets as it can be time consuming and distracting.\r\n\r\n“School is stressful enough. Don’t put additional pressure on yourself to follow a perfect diet.” \r\n\r\nAlthough it may sound like a cliché by now, everything in moderation really does seem to be the key.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-07-28 09:08:51-04	2011-07-28 09:02:58-04	2011-07-28 09:02:58-04	t
320	Making the most of a summer paycheque	38	making-most-summer-paycheque	589		When I was hired for my first-ever summer job, I was excited at the prospect of being able to accumulate savings. Despite my best efforts, checking my balance online has become a cringe-worthy routine. Between summer sales, weekend trips and margarita nights, I seem to be burning through my paycheques.\r\n\r\nAccording to Alison Stolz, a financial advisor at TD Canada Trust in Kingston, saving money during the summer doesn’t have to be hard.\r\n\r\n“I think that as a student you’re so busy during the school year you don’t notice that you stick to more of a budget,” she said, adding that when you have more time to spend money, budgeting just seems harder.\r\n\r\nHere are some of her tips for students looking to give their bank accounts a boost.\r\n\r\n<strong>Preauthorized transfers</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to set up automatic, preauthorized transfers from a chequing account to a savings account. Money can be transferred monthly, every few weeks or using any other time frame.\r\n\r\n“If it’s an automatic transfer, it’s going to be sent to your savings account no matter what you have going on,” Stolz said.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to set up your account so that with every debit transaction, money is automatically transferred to your savings. It can be as little as 50 cents but it will add up.\r\n\r\n<strong>Look at the small things</strong>\r\n\r\n“If you’re going to buy a five dollar coffee every day, that’s really going to add up,” Stolz said. \r\n\r\nLooking at the little things you spend money on and cutting back on them will make a big difference.\r\n\r\n<strong>Be realistic</strong>\r\n\r\nEven though the summer season presents more opportunities to go out to restaurants and bars, it’s important to know when you won’t be able to splurge, Stolz said. \r\n\r\nThis may be difficult, especially during the summer. That’s why physically budgeting where your money needs to go will help.\r\n\r\n<strong>Make a physical budget</strong>\r\n\r\nTaking the time to write down a physical budget of how much money needs to go towards certain expenses such as utilities and groceries will help you figure out how much money you have leftover to play with.\r\n\r\n “You really realize where your money is going,” Stolz said.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-07-28 08:55:42-04	2011-07-28 08:49:11-04	2011-07-28 08:49:11-04	t

319	Where have all the people gone?	38	where-have-all-people-gone	528		Whether it’s a job, courses or the desire to continue living independently, there are plenty of incentives to remain in Kingston for summer. \r\nSpending summer here makes you feel like a real Kingstonian. But as your steady circle of friends from Queen’s dwindles and the campus depopulates, the time can initially be hard to fill. Here are the ways I hope to branch out this summer:\r\n\r\n<strong>Become a Kingston connoisseur</strong>\r\n\r\nGain a familiarity with the city that only summer leisure time can bring. Try every patio, sushi spot and boutique so that you can be the local expert when your friends return. I plan to hop on 1,000 Islands Cruises’ Discovery Cruise and become an expert on Kingston’s history. It may seem random, but I’m sure this information will come in handy during small talk. \r\n\r\n<strong>Host a party</strong>\r\n\r\nOther people will likely be looking for something to do and for other people to do it with. Having a party is the perfect way to pass the time and let different groups of friends mingle. Pretty soon you’ll have a whole network of summer friends.\r\n<strong>\r\nCatch up with old acquaintances</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you’re here, this has probably happened to you already. Strolling down Princess Street, you bump into an old pal from first year who you wish you hadn’t lost touch with. If you both express interest in hanging out, follow through! You’ll have all summer to catch up and re-establish those old friendships. Invite them to your aforementioned party. \r\n\r\n<strong>Make friends with locals</strong>\r\n\r\nMake an effort to get to know your neighbours, your co-workers or friendly acquaintances. There’s a whole untapped network of people who have nothing to do with Queen’s and are sure to enrich your summer experience. \r\n\r\n<strong>Events in Kingston you don’t want to miss</strong>\r\n\r\nDoors Open Kingston  (June 18)\r\n\r\nTake a peek at some of Kingston’s fine establishments, including Agnes Benidickson House, HMCS Cataraqui at Kingston’s naval reserve, Kingston Police Headquarters and the Shoal Tower National Historic Sites.

315	Relevant is relative 	33	relevant-is-relative	643		By Holly Tousignant, Supplements Editor\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 3, 2009, the <em>Journal</em> published an article I wrote called “<a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2009-11-03/news/destigmatizing-mental-health-issues/">Destigmatizing mental health issues</a>.” This story was not about a specific student event or activity that had happened on campus; rather, it was about the stigma surrounding mental illness in general and the effect that stigma has on Queen’s students. In the comment section, several readers thanked the <em>Journal</em> and the very candid interviewee featured for raising such an important, relevant issue. I also received personal messages on Facebook saying the same thing. \r\n\r\nI’m not exactly sure what the motion passed by Assembly means by “student activities and events,” but I would guess that this article wouldn’t make the cut.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nOn Mar. 26, 2010 another piece was published called “<a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2010-03-26/news/talking-hybrid-learning-models/">Talking hybrid learning models</a>,” also written by myself. The story, written as part of news’ special project for that year, was about the models of virtualization that were proposed by the Principal’s Taskforce on Virtualization. I don’t think the content of this story would fall under the “student events and activities” category either, but I would dare anyone to argue that proposed changes to the way classes are taught isn’t of the utmost relevance to students. In writing that story, I had the opportunity to educate students on an issue most of them likely knew very little about. \r\n\r\nThese are just two of the many pieces I have written in my nearly three years working at the <em>Journal</em>, first as a contributor, then as Assistant News Editor and now as Supplements Editor. I have also written stories about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, racist assaults on West Campus, the stress of first year, the adaptive technology centre and the closure of Kingston’s prison farms. Are any of these stories directly about “student activities and events?” Perhaps not, but I do think they’re some of the most thought-provoking, relevant pieces I’ve had the privilege of working on. Not just to me, but to the student body as a whole.  \r\n\r\nI am proud of the work I have done at the <em>Journal</em>, not simply because I think it has served me well, but because I believe the stories I have been a part of have been of genuine interest to students. My stories have stirred passion, anger and debate in students. You don’t debate about things that don’t deeply interest you. \r\n\r\nI think if you were to ask the members of Assembly who voted for the motion to pass, they would not disagree that what I have said is true. But they might ask what the harm is in simply taking a look at the statistics. \r\n\r\nAs others have said before me, there is no harm in this. The harm comes from the AMS, the corporation that funds the <em>Journal</em>, being the ones to facilitate this audit. As others have also mentioned, there is still no real harm so long as the AMS doesn’t plan on implementing changes based on their findings. But if this is not the intention, why waste the time and resources to do the audit at all?  \r\n\r\nHere’s what I honestly think will come out of this if the motion isn’t overturned: the data will create a stir for a day or so, then it will get stuffed in a drawer somewhere and forgotten about, in which case it will have been a mere waste of time. Of course, there’s also the chance that the results will get blown out of proportion, influencing how future editors do their job. Many “#teamjournal” critics I’ve come across don’t understand what would be so bad about the <em>Journal</em> changing their practices based on the results of the audit. I hope they keep those attitudes in mind when the <em>Journal</em> is being pressured to write about faculty bake sales and car washes over mental health issues, academic planning and other important topics. \r\n\r\nSo please, come out to the AMS AGM and vote to reverse the motion. Not just because it will make my life easier or even because it’s the right thing to do, but because next year when you open up the paper, I can guarantee you’ll want to be reading the stories editors are capable of coming up with free from AMS influence. \r\n	t	t	2011-04-14 08:29:25-04	2011-03-21 23:44:38-04	2011-03-21 23:44:38-04	t
314	Understanding implications 	33	understanding-implications	643		By Clare Clancy, News Editor\r\n\r\nHearing the words “Queen’s Journal” and “content” spoken about together in an AMS assembly discussion shocked me. My shock turned to disbelief when, following this discussion, AMS assembly passed a motion which mandates the Media Services Director to provide an analysis of <em>Journal</em> content quantifying articles that directly address “student activities and events”. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, I worked as an Assistant News Editor for the <em>Journal</em>, and during that time attended countless AMS assemblies. In my year of reporting on student government happenings, I never heard a single discussion like this.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThere is a good reason it was never brought up, and that is editorial autonomy. The <em>Journal</em>’s content is something chosen by the editors of the <em>Journal</em> and no one else. This is of paramount importance to anyone who values the aim of a newspaper and its ability to hold people and institutions accountable. When a student politician causes controversy or when people ask us not to write a story because of its heated nature, <em>Journal</em> staff members continue to report, aware that at the end of the day, what goes in the paper is up to us. No, the motion doesn’t directly address editorial autonomy but  it does have implications for the future of <em>Journal</em> content.\r\n\r\nThe motion brought forward at assembly is disturbing for many reasons. First, if an analysis is  conducted, what percentage of content relating directly to student activities and events will be deemed acceptable? What does this mean? Does this mean that stories relating to Queen’s clubs are to be thought more valuable than those relating to the Kingston community? \r\n\r\nPersonally, I thought coverage of the Kingston mayoral elections was one of the most important things in the <em>Journal</em> this year. While it wasn’t a student-run activity or event, the results of our municipal elections directly impact Queen’s as a community within Kingston. We have an obligation to inform students of changes in local politics which impact their daily lives and Queen’s as a whole.  \r\n\r\nIt is possible that with information from this audit available, future editors of the <em>Journal</em> will be pressured to live up to a certain percentage. As one of two incoming Editors in Chief, I find this a scary thought.\r\n\r\nSecond, the motion asks the AMS Media Services Director to perform an analysis that is virtually impossible and will lead to flawed results. The information collected will not be helpful in any way. How do you decide if something falls under the umbrella of a “student activity or event”? For example, incoming AMS Academic Affairs Commissioner Mira Dineen was interviewed for an article about poverty in Kingston on Jan. 18. She is a student who co-authored a book on the subject, but the focus of the article was on poverty in the surrounding community. Was this an important and worthwhile story? Absolutely. Does the article relate to a student activity? I’m unsure. It relates to one student’s activity. How many students need to be part of the activity for it to be counted? My point is that the <em>Journal</em> writes for the Queen’s community and we know our readers’ interests. After all, we are students too. I think the time and resources of the Media Services Director can be  better spent elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe third issue I have with this motion is that I don’t believe its stated intention. We all know ‘information for the sake of information’ isn’t the real reason the motion was brought forward. There are those who believe <em>Journal</em> content to be questionable at times. I will say that despite what many readers might think, <em>Journal</em> staff  are open to criticism and we are aware that mistakes are made. It is for this reason that in policy we print clarifications and corrections. After all, we are student journalists and we are learning our trade. That said, there are avenues available to address the concerns of the only people we really care about: our readers. Part of <em>Journal</em> policy includes publishing letters to the editor, seeking out opinion editorial pieces from members of the Queen’s community and holding open editorial boards each semester. If that isn’t enough, we make ourselves available through every medium possible. Whether it’s having an open door policy at the Journal House, being available through social media like Twitter and Facebook or emailing one of the two dozen addresses on the <em>Journal</em> website (section specific for convenience), we accept and encourage open dialogue with readers.\r\n\r\nIf you are still reading this blog post, let me say there is one redeemable quality of the motion. I appreciate the amendment made by Media Services Director Sarah Kwong. I am relieved that she removed other media services like CFRC and QTV from the motion, which originally mandated all AMS media to be audited. No  media service which values editorial autonomy should be subjected to the same ridiculous notion of ‘content analysis’ as the <em>Journal</em> is now. \r\n\r\nWhat worries me the most is that the people who voted for this motion, those on AMS assembly who said ‘let us collect information for information’s sake’, are unaware of the true implications  their decision holds.\r\nInfringement on editorial autonomy has to begin somewhere. I think AMS assembly members who voted in favour of  this motion should reconsider what it means for the future of the <em>Journal</em> and Queen’s community at large. 	t	t	2011-04-14 08:29:40-04	2011-03-20 22:21:44-04	2011-03-20 22:21:44-04	t
313	An open letter to members of the AMS	33	an-open-letter-to-members-of-the-ams	643		By Jessica Fishbein, Assistant News Editor\r\n\r\nAbout this time last year, defying all my cautious optimism and wildest expectations, I was hired as an Assistant News Editor for the Journal. This continues to baffle me and I am eternally grateful to Tyler Ball and Rachel Kuper for taking a gamble and giving me this opportunity, given the fact that I had no prior experience writing for the <em>Journal</em>. \r\n\r\nI think at this point it is fair to say that this “job” has changed my life.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis year, I have been given a chance to explore new opportunities I had never known existed. This experience has allowed me to hear the views of some of the most intelligent people I have ever had the privilege of meeting, let alone working with, in my life. It has made me confident in my own abilities and made me realize, as cliché as it is, that with hard work and determination, what I want to do with my life is within my grasp.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most rewarding part of my job, however, is how much it has opened my eyes to new issues; issues that I wasn’t aware of before and wouldn’t have known about if this job weren’t available to me. Apparently, having the ability to learn so much about a wide range of new things is one of the best parts of being a journalist, and from my experience I can now 100% agree. By nature we don’t know everything, so we get to learn all that we can from our interview subjects, who are the real experts.\r\n\r\nI seriously believe that if this motion is passed, the incoming News Editor's experience at the <em>Journal</em> will have the possibility of being severely restricted, and other students will not be lucky enough to have the same experience as I did. \r\n\r\nI respect what the AMS does and have nothing but reverence and astonishment at the amount of time and effort that is put in by its dedicated staff into all of its important initiatives and endeavours. I wholeheartedly support the sentiment that students deserve to know about the happenings within the AMS and faculty societies.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the motion is passed, I fear that the incoming Assistant News Editors’ learning experiences could be much more limited to only reading about happenings within the AMS. \r\n\r\nPerhaps what everyone fails to realize is that News only receives so much space in the newspaper. There are other things students undeniably want and should be able to read about, such as Editorials, Dialogue, Arts and Entertainment, and much more.\r\n\r\nWhat were to happen if we were given a quota on how much to report on AMS and faculty societies that we would have to fill? What would happen if there were potentially bigger issues facing students that we wouldn’t be able to report about, because it didn’t fall into one of these quota categories? Would these sections listed above no longer exist?\r\n\r\nMy worries lie in what the implications of such a survey could be. It makes me wonder why the AMS wants to conduct a report on our content, if or how this report will be analyzed, and what actions will be taken after this analysis? In my mind, presentation of such content will undoubtedly lead to the analysis of such content, and there is no way an analysis will remain unbiased.\r\n\r\nI truly believe there is cause for worry because naturally, there are intentions behind everything—no data is collected just for the sake of collecting data. Why would this action be pointless?\r\n\r\nMore importantly, how are we supposed to remain unbiased as a newspaper if our publisher is telling us what we have to write about?\r\n\r\nNot to be dramatic, but the fact that the AMS is attempting to remove this component is almost like censoring what we choose to write about.\r\n\r\nIt shows an inherent lack of trust from the student government to allow student journalists to do our job.\r\n\r\n(I also find it personally offensive that I am not given this trust by my student representatives when I have sat for eight consecutive hours at AMS Assemblies listening to them debate issues in order to objectively report on it for students.)\r\n\r\nRoberta Bondar, Paul Martin, Emily Haines, Bedouin Soundclash - these are just a few of the prestigious people my colleagues have had the chance to interview, due to the Journal’s editorial autonomy.\r\n\r\nIf the AMS deems after this audit that faculty societies are more important for students to read about, not only will student journalists be unable to have these amazing opportunities afforded to them, readers will also lose out.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day we are a newspaper run by students. Myself and my fellow Assistant News Editors, Katherine-Fernandez Blance and Labiba Haque can only be physically responsible for covering so many events, and thus have to help make the decisions of what makes the paper each issue. It is natural for people to wish to read about what serves their own self-interests—even if it does speak to a sense of entitlement about what people deem is relevant to students—but not everyone is going to be happy 100% of the time. \r\n	t	t	2011-04-14 08:29:50-04	2011-03-20 02:28:36-04	2011-03-20 02:28:36-04	t
312	Strength in numbers 	33	strength-in-numbers	643		By Katherine Fernandez-Blance, Assistant News Editor\r\n\r\nI recently conducted a survey of all the articles I had ever written for the Queen’s Journal. This wasn’t done to pad my ego, but rather in light of the motion passed at AMS assembly that will now require the incoming Media Services Director to undergo a similar assessment of all of the <em>Journal</em>’s content, correlating percentages to coverage of ‘student events’ and ‘student activities.’  \r\n\r\nI write this article fully condemning the motion and the rationale of those who helped it pass. The results of my survey did not shock me, but for those who are for the collection of data in this manner, please read on to enlighten yourself as to why this is a motion that will waste resources, hinder editorial autonomy, and prove entirely irrelevant to the student body. \r\n\r\nI’ve written for the <em>Journal</em> for the past two years. Because my stories have been predominantly for the News section, that is where my numbers are based. I only analyzed my own articles because I lacked the time to do the same for others in the News section.  <!--more-->\r\n\r\nSince I started in 2009, I have written 52 stories. By even skimming through them, I found that 48% are immediately directly related to student events or activities. This was obvious by looking at the title of the article in most cases. \r\n\r\n9.6% dealt with issues that affected members of the administration, 7.7% dealt with news on a more local or provincial scale, and 3.8% (two articles) focused on professors winning awards. \r\n\r\nThe way the <em>Journal</em> is run isn’t always the most transparent and I believe that this is where a lot of the confusion and anger stems from. In the News section, once a month we write three or four articles for the ‘Campus Catchup’ section. These short articles relate to occurrences that are happening at other Canadian universities. 13.5% of my articles fell into this category. \r\n\r\nThe <em>Journal</em> is one of the few student newspapers in Canada that doesn’t regularly report on events at other universities. We like to keep our content focused on issues that directly affect Queen’s Students. The articles written in ‘Campus Catchup’ do not involve Queen’s activities or events, but as the writers, we believe that they are of both interest and relevance to students since many of the issues addressed can have national implications for postsecondary institutions as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe final area that my articles fell into (17% of them) was gray. This is the crux of the matter in practical terms. Does an obituary of a student fall under ‘student activity’? How about Islamic history month, which many Queen’s students participated in in October, though the month was part of a national movement? The registrar’s office forcing some engineering students to pay extra tuition wasn’t an event undertaken by students, but it was an activity that effected students. \r\n\r\nWhere do you draw the line?\r\n\r\nCollecting these results took me the better part of an hour. Translate that into a survey of every section from every issue for a year. This has never been part of the Media Services Director’s portfolio, so where will this extra time come from and where will resources have to be drawn from? \r\n\r\nIs it realistic to assume the Director will be pouring through every article written for the <em>Journal</em> in the past year? If not, will they have to search for buzzwords like ‘student’ or ‘event’ and then tally everything up? What happens to articles in the gray area, like I have mentioned above? \r\n\r\nI am trying to appeal to you from a practical perspective, so I will only touch on editorial autonomy. \r\n\r\nPlease think about this motion with some common sense. Once all the ‘data’ is analyzed, where do we go from there? If the <em>Journal</em> is found to have less than an ‘ideal’ percentage of content that focuses on ‘student events’ and ‘activities,’ will we be recommended to improve this? Who will decide what the appropriate percentage is? \r\n\r\nYou don’t have to be involved in the <em>Journal</em> at all to realize what this motion implies. It is NOT up to the AMS to decide our content, but with this motion, those who support it are treading a very fine line. \r\n\r\nThe information we present in each issue is not inaccessible. You can see in every issue for free, online or in print, where your student dollars are going towards. We aren’t trying to hide anything, but this motion is. \r\n\r\nPlease consider the implications of this motion. If it’s a waste of time, why do it? If it’s not, what precedent will this set? \r\n\r\n<strong>Vote to reverse this motion at the AMS’s AGM: Tuesday March 22nd, 8:30pm, Ban Righ Dining Hall. Vote for common sense, and for your campus newspaper. </strong>\r\n \r\n	t	t	2011-04-14 08:30:04-04	2011-03-19 20:44:26-04	2011-03-19 20:44:26-04	t
311	Interfering and delegitimizing	33	interfering-and-delegitimizing	643		By Andrew Stokes, Copy Editor\r\n\r\nInitially, the AMS motion to audit the <em>Journal</em> didn’t worry me. It mandates Media Services Director Sarah Kwong to “...conduct an analysis of the content of AMS media during the current academic year and to subsequently report on the percentage of content that directly addresses student activities and events.”\r\n\r\n\tThis motion is seemingly benign: it appears to be a fact-finding mission—knowledge for knowledge’s sake. However, upon further consideration of the issue I changed my mind. My belief that it was a simple study without policy implications was nothing short of naïve. <!--more-->\r\n\r\n\tThere are only a few potential outcomes and none are desirable. First of all: the analysis is conducted and the <em>Journal</em> is found to be relevant to student life. In this case the audit was a waste of time, and there are no repercussions beyond lost time, energy and resources. The second outcome is that the <em>Journal</em> is found to report a percentage of news addressing student activities and events that is insufficient, and in this case there is no sequential action taken (again, an apparent waste of time, energy, etcetera). The third outcome is that the <em>Journal</em> is found to be insufficient and the AMS subsequently suggests or mandates that the Journal report more about student issues.\r\n\r\n\tThe trouble with the latter outcome is that it infringes on the<em> Journal</em>’s right to editorial autonomy—a constitutionally guaranteed right. \r\n\r\n\tLosing autonomy is a serious problem that completely delegitimizes this publication and by association, our school. Editorial autonomy, in short, is a publication’s right to be free from interference. This includes the content and stories reported, as well as the stances taken on whatever issues are editorialized. \r\n\r\n\tThis motion does not directly remove the <em>Journal</em>’s right to autonomy, but it lays the groundwork whereby this autonomy could be eroded, and perhaps removed one day. \r\n\r\n\tIt’s a matter that concerns all members the Queen’s body; a frequent publication that reports the relevant goings on and holds elected officials accountable is a fundamental piece of a healthy democratic environment, including a university. \r\n\r\n\tThis is not a personal matter; it’s ideological. A publication is only responsible to its readers, and their concerns can be voiced in a way that is constructive, not damaging. There is an entire section of the paper dedicated to “Dialogue,” and criticism is welcome, as it helps point the direction in which the <em>Journal</em> can grow and improve. \r\n\r\n\tOur publication is not beyond reproach, but to question the relevance of our content is a slight to the entire operation. One need look no further than the front page to see stories that address student activities and events. The issue on March 18 features stories regarding Queen’s response to the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan, student governments’ responses to the rector controversy and success of the women’s hockey team, to name a few.  \r\n\r\n\t The potential that has the <em>Journal</em> worried is if we as a whole are refused the right to report on these events and instead report what the AMS decides for us. \r\n\r\n\tWe are a relatively small operation with limited resources, but we welcome criticism. If you feel that we missed an important event, or that our coverage was in some way lacking, please let us know. When the readers want improvement, we will endeavor to improve; after all, we want to report the stories that matter to you.	t	t	2011-04-14 08:30:19-04	2011-03-19 13:58:33-04	2011-03-19 13:58:33-04	t

318	Shaping up for summer	32	shaping-summer	528		Summer sees a surge of people wanting to amp up their fitness routine. Whether it’s to look good lounging by the pool or to fulfill aspirations of outdoor adventure, summer offers unique opportunities for exercise. Here are four activities for summer fitness that are far from routine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Outdoor boot camp</strong>\r\n\r\nBoot camp showcases interesting and varied outdoor exercise. Boot camp can be understood as full-body functional, exercise-based circuit training. According to instructor Pam Fountas, boot camps push people to physical extremes that can’t be reached in a solo workout.\r\n\r\nShort intervals and circuits make boot camp time-effective and challenging. Changing environmental factors are an added plus.\r\n\r\nFountas said the results are more than just physical.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the day, pushing yourself to physical limits translates into other aspects of your life. Not only does it burn calories, it builds confidence as well.”\r\n\r\n<em>Pam Fountas is the instructor of Limitless Living Boot Camp 4 Women. Spaces are still available Mondays and Wednesdays at 6:30 p.m. Email pam_fountas@hotmail.com for details. </em>\r\n<strong>\r\nKayaking</strong>\r\n\r\nIt isn’t necessary to travel to cottage country to enjoy the pleasures of paddling through the water. Get a view of Kingston’s waterfront via kayak. Coordinating muscles in the upper-body, abdominal region, hips and legs, makes kayaking an especially effective workout. Whether you want to go for an intense high-powered trip or a leisurely paddle, set your own pace.\r\n\r\n<em>Ahoy Rentals at 23 Ontario Street offers kayaking, sailing, canoeing and cycling as recreational options. Visit ahoyrentals.com to find out about rentals, rates and hours.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>ARC fitness classes </strong>\r\n\r\nThe ARC still provides creative exercise options in the summertime. A number of new classes have been added through the Fitness and Wellness program.\r\n\r\nPiloboxing combines high-energy boxing movements with Pilates toners, making for a high-intensity workout. Hoop Dance offers a workout for your core, wrists and shoulders. A program called Recreational Fitness and Games has also been introduced where participants can choose games to play each week. Options include floor hockey, European handball or basketball.\r\n\r\n<em>To check out classes, fees and packages, visit gogaelsgo.com. </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Running outdoors</strong>\r\n\r\nHere’s another simple way to enjoy Kingston’s waterfront while getting some exercise. Grab some friends and try out the Beat Beethoven Run Event on June 5. People will have the chance to run a 4km or 8km track in the city while the Kingston Symphony plays Beethoven’s music. Runners are challenged to complete the running course before the 50 minutes of music is up. If running’s not your thing, just grab a gelato and watch--you can always pretend you finished early!\r\n\r\n<em>Visit beatbeethovenkingston.com for more information.</em>	t	t	2012-05-15 09:21:41.184442-04	2011-06-04 16:58:22-04	2011-06-04 16:58:22-04	t
309	Arbitrary and frightening	33	arbitrary-and-frightening	643		By Lauri Kytömaa, Assistant Sports Editor\r\n\r\nComing in as the Assistant Sports Editor for the 2010-2011 staff of the Queen’s Journal I had no intention of getting involved in any sort of political debate. A recent motion issued by the AMS assembly has changed that.\r\n\r\nThe motion requires the Media Services Director (Sarah Kwong) to “conduct an analysis of the content of The Queen’s Journal during the current academic year and to subsequently report on the percentage of content that directly addresses student activities and events.” \r\n\r\nThe passing of such a motion is both arbitrary and frightening. It is arbitrary because we are the Queen’s student newspaper.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n From the front page of the News section to back of the Postscript the paper is made by students to be read by students. There is hardly any material that doesn’t relate in some way to the campus community. News is strictly oriented to Queen’s campus activities, administration and student life.  Features are just the same. Opinions and Letters (now Dialogue) are chiefly written by students not on the <em>Journal</em> Editorial Board, Arts focuses on the Kingston happenings, Sports are entirely isolated to the Queen’s Gaels and Postscript too is totally focused on campus life. \r\n\r\nSadly it seems that the members of the AMS body have failed to pick up a copy of the Journal in recent history. “Percentage of content that directly addresses student activities and events” what the hell does that even mean? Is a 95% good enough? \r\n\r\nYet this motion is frightening because it may represent a first step in undermining the freedom of the press for the University’s most prominent paper. The AMS may further begin to infringe on the editorial freedom of the paper. By making judgements on what stories should be covered and which ones should be omitted the AMS would take a disturbingly totalitarian control over a body that they should have no control over. \r\n\r\nA good paper derives from creativity and freedom to discuss what an editorial board thinks needs to be discussed. Constantly double checking with a third-party would cripple the <em>Journal</em>’s ability to produce a good product. It would take longer to make sure things were allowed to be written and even longer in bitter debate.\r\n\r\nMy jaded view on political bodies has only grown as a result of this process. It appears that the AMS cannot find anything better to do than arbitrarily strip the power of the school’s student paper.

310	Arcane obstructions	33	arcane-obstructions	413		Dear Journal staff,\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of confusion about what happened on Thursday at AMS Assembly. This is my attempt to lay it all out for you guys.\r\n\r\nFirst, some background. The AMS has a very basic behind the scenes relationship with the Journal. Basically, the AMS is the Journal's publisher, and so we have to be financially accountable to them. This is why we have J-Board and why we can't spend all of our budget on beer.\r\n\r\nParallel to that, we are afforded editorial autonomy. The only buzzwords we like; this basically means we can write whatever we want.\r\n\r\nWe also have the mandate to provide meaningful journalism experience for our volunteers, that's you guys. John Stackhouse told us that at least 10-12 people in the Globe newsroom are Journal alumni. Not bad for a school with no formal journalism program.\r\n\r\nAt AMS Assembly three weeks ago (before reading week) Victoria Pleavin, EngSoc president, drafted a bunch of motions, one for every commissioner and director of the AMS. These range from institutionalizing faculty rivalries to getting the MAC to conduct a campus-wide housing survey. \r\n\r\nShe wanted to come to Assembly "with a pile of motions to fix many of these problems and more since clearly it's not going to be done with any sort of initiative of this executive." Some of them may have been great ideas, if brought to Assembly with some forethought and consultation with those involved. Her motion relating to the Journal had neither.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe motion for Sarah Kwong, Media Services Director read:\r\n\r\n"That AMS Assembly directs the Media Services Director to conduct an analysis of the content of AMS media during the current academic year and to subsequently report on the percentage of content that directly addresses student activities and events."\r\n\r\nBecause of all these motions, they didn't get to ours until the next Assembly, on Thursday night. Sarah had "AMS media" changed to just "The Queen's Journal", which I supported because it's more honest. We all know who Ms. Pleavin is really after.\r\n\r\nIt's a grudge. In her statement to Assembly on Feb. 3rd Ms. Pleavin lied and said we ignored the requests of the EngSoc Chief Returning Officer by releasing their election results early. There were no such requests and I have emails to prove it. I'm extremely offended by this, because the writers that worked very hard all election night don't deserve to be slandered.\r\n\r\nMs. Pleavin, in explaining her reasons for the motion, said that engineering students are unfairly represented in the Journal. However, if she looked she would notice we don't really cover any of the faculty societies' events that often. It's not out of malice, but that other things take precedent and that we don't receive many requests for publicity from faculty societies.\r\n\r\nSo, on Thursday night I got up and tried to defend the Journal. I said all those things in the first four paragraphs and how they relate to our coverage: We cover a wide variety of things to provide good experience for our writers and provide a paper students actually want to read so we can sell ads to cover our costs and be financially accountable to the AMS—the only thing they should care about. This is why we have more than just a News section.\r\n\r\nBut, the majority of Assembly's members stood up and said things along the lines of "I think it would be good to have this data" without knowing the specifics of the AMS-Journal relationship. I'm disappointed that some of those representatives that are familiar didn't speak up and help clear the air. I also had much more to say when the motion was called to question, cutting off the speakers list. Talk about a dysfunctional body.\r\n\r\nThere's a reasonable discussion there about our coverage and faculty societies. Perhaps there's more we could be doing about fac socs, but they don't communicate with us about stories nor do they cooperate with us when we do want to write something. It's a two-way street. Ms. Pleavin has been notoriously impossible to contact this year. If you won't talk to us, why should we care about your initiatives? \r\n\r\nI don't have a problem with someone doing a study of the Journal's content. Ms. Pleavin could do one herself by bringing up the Journal website and counting articles that address "student activities and events". The percentage that do would probably surprise her.\r\n\r\nThe point is that the directive is coming from the AMS, a purely governmental component of the corporation that publishes the Journal. They have no place talking about the Editorial content of the Journal, as written in their constitution, even for an analytical purpose. \r\n\r\nIt sets a dangerous precedent. If you have a room full of egotistical, self-important politicians talking about assessing the Journal, who says they can't start talking about it more? I strongly believe that the Journal's autonomy and effectiveness to report will not be lost in one big fight with the AMS, but inch-by-inch, behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nThis is why we need to speak out. I want anyone involved with the Journal, or who cares about the Journal, to write a blog post about why this motion effects how you do your job. Emotionally, mentally. Does it make you second guess writing about something or someone?\r\n\r\nWe need to talk to our friends about it. If they ask you questions, try to answer them or show them this post. If they are dismissive, tell them to look at some other campus newspapers in Canada. They will find that Queen's students are lucky they have the Journal, despite all our critics.\r\n\r\nThe Journal is an institution of almost 139 years. It's bigger than the sum of it's parts, so we all need to step up and contribute to that sum. We're so lucky to have a staff that cares so much and takes so much time out of their lives to create each issue. Without you I would have no reason to be mad, because there would be no Journal. Speaking out from multiple perspectives will strengthen our cause.\r\n\r\nSend your posts to me at this address or to Terra at journal_blogs@ams.queensu.ca.\r\n\r\nTyler Ball\r\nEditor in Chief\r\nThe Queen's Journal	t	t	2011-04-14 08:31:11-04	2011-03-18 17:04:56-04	2011-03-18 17:04:56-04	t
308	Extend and reciprocate	33	extend-and-reciprocate	643		By Catherine Owsik, Copy Editor\r\n\r\nI came into the Journal this year with little knowledge of the paper, the process and especially the people involved. After a couple training sessions and editorial boards I felt perfectly at ease and soon enough we all became more than colleagues, we became more like teammates … unfortunately it’s starting to look like we actually have an opposing team to band against. \r\n\r\nI guess I came into the position with a bit of a naïve outlook, when I heard there was tension between various groups and the Journal I thought it couldn’t be true, it must’ve been a thing of past years. I’m sad to say that since then my opinion has changed, and the recent motion brought towards the AMS from Victoria Pleavin has just reinforced this.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMy realization of a bias against the Journal began when I helped cover the AMS elections by attending an AMS election party. For the most part everyone was kind and friendly, and it felt wonderful to share the nerves and excitement with such a large group of people, but there were a couple instances where this wasn’t the case.\r\n\r\nEarly on in the night I was approached by a man and after he had finished introducing himself he asked what I was doing with a pad of paper in my hand, “Oh I’m here from the Journal …”, and before I could even finish introducing myself he had cocked his body back with a look of disgust. Really? I was so surprised with his reaction that I went straight out with it and asked him why he didn’t like the Journal … And he had no answer. He sputtered about some past event that he clearly had no real opinion of and then walked away. \r\n\r\nThis same situation happened again during the night, just with a different person who was even more abrupt and rude. I’ve got to say that it wasn’t so much that my feelings were hurt as that I was just in awe that someone would take their friend-of-a-friend’s opinion of the Journal so much to heart that they would be rude to a complete stranger. \r\n\r\nThe recent motion brought to AMS Assembly reminds of that night. There is no reason why the content we published throughout the year should be investigated; the Journal is an informative publication that relays content to students and faculty that they would actually enjoy to read.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, the only difference between our layout and a national newspaper is the absence of a cartoon section … which (if I’m allowed a bit of a joke) is why the Golden Words is on campus. It’s really unfortunate that some personal grudges are growing out of hand to the point of questioning our content and legitimacy. \r\n\r\nWhat problem do people really have with the Journal? And to those who do, wouldn’t you like these problems addressed? All I can think of is that if nobody can say anything then there is just going to be a growing animosity between groups in the school that will be passed on from year to year, quickly losing the why.\r\n\r\nAt the <em>Journal</em> we pride ourselves in being a student-run publication and it is really unfortunate to see our editorial autonomy being questioned like this by fellow students. I would like to start seeing a change away from this cycle of grudges, if we extend an arm to faculty societies and ask for your opinion and help, I hope to get a response.	t	t	2011-04-14 08:31:24-04	2011-03-18 13:59:51-04	2011-03-18 13:59:51-04	t
306	Late goal wins bronze for Gaels	33	late-goal-wins-bronze-for-gaels	595		<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-1"-->\r\n\r\nThe Golden Hawks dominated their regular season match-ups with the Gaels including a particularly painful 8-1 loss in January. But this year’s Queen’s Gaels don’t roll over; a big factor in their competing in the CIS Championship. The Gaels battled hard in the bronze medal game coming out on top with a late goal by defender Kerstin van Bolderen. \r\n\r\nLaurier pressured early in the first but with a flurry of penalties called, both teams were left to fend off man advantages. The Golden Hawks had a huge advantage with a five-on-three after interference penalties were called first on forward Brittany McHaffie and then defence Kerstin van Bolderen. Gaels held off the Laurier power play amounting to a momentum swing for Queen’s. A quick opportunity by Kench and a Thomson shot that went off the post were two of the Gaels’ better chances in the period. The Gaels ended the period with 12 shots on net to Laurier’s nine. \r\n\r\nPenalties took over the second period with the Gaels and Golden Hawks taking four each.  In one of the more intense moments of the period, Laurier was rewarded a penalty shot; their second in the playoffs against the Gaels, dating back to their OUA semifinals. Dodd-Moher, who has been one of the Gaels’ strongest players all tournament, shut down the Laurier player. The Gaels’ play during their second period did not create as many opportunities with only four shots on net. \r\n\r\nWith no score going into the third, both teams had an air of desperation in their play knowing that whoever scores first could have the winning goal. With penalties less of an issue in the third, the Gaels and Golden Hawks had a fierce battle exchanging opportunities throughout the 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nvan Bolderen converted a pass by Kench with less than two minutes to play in the game. The lone goal of the game would stand and Queen’s would go home with the bronze medal in their first CIS finals tournament in Queen’s history.\r\n\r\n<em>For full coverage, pick up an issue of the Journal on Friday. </em> \r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 13:01:16-04	2011-03-14 02:42:33-04	2011-03-14 02:42:33-04	t
305	Bronze no cake walk for Gaels	33	bronze-no-cake-walk-for-gaels	595		<!--image:"gaelswhockey2z"-->\r\n\r\nThe Gaels’ playoff season has been called ‘miraculous’. A winning streak that ended yesterday after beginning in January, a record of 5-1 after being scored on first and an improbable (and well publicized) six overtime marathon game that contributed to their first OUA title. The Gaels (and those who have watched them) know that they deserve to be here; they earned their berth and they’ve battled against the best for it. \r\n\r\nThe Gaels have faced tough competition on their run; defeating the Guelph Gryphons and the Laurier Golden Hawks, both nationally-ranked teams. The Alberta Pandas were defending CIS champions and the Gaels took them out in a shootout. \r\n\r\nIntimidation and pressure won’t faze these Gaels. They believe in the power of their team.\r\n\r\nGoaltender Mel Dodd-Moher has stood tall time and time again in net for the Gaels. Her play against the McGill Martlets proved that there was no luck in her success against OUA competition. Skill and confidence have proven her to be one of the best goaltenders of the tournament. \r\nThe strong presence of veteran line Liz Kench, Becky Conroy and Kelsey Thomson create an impact every time they’re on the ice. Whether it be with their talented stick-handling or their physical presence, this line asserts itself against any competition.\r\n\r\nThe McHaffie twins have been the most visible presence in the playoffs especially coming off the OUA postseason where they scored winning goals in the Laurier and Guelph series. \r\n\r\nAlthough Queen’s defeated Laurier to advance to the OUA finals, the Gaels will not overlook the consistently powerful Golden Hawks team. Laurier swept the Gaels in their regular season series including a particularly painful 8-1 loss in January. \r\n\r\nTo put the Laurier team into perspective Justin Fauteux, Sports Editor at the Cord (Laurier’s student newspaper) wrote, “This season was a bit of a strange one for the Laurier Golden Hawks. For starters, they lost three games, which is more than they lost in the previous two seasons combined.” Adding to the strangeness, he said, was that Queen’s was able to sweep them in the postseason.\r\n\r\nLaurier boasts one of the most impressive goaltenders in the country in Liz Knox. Reigning CIS player of the year, Knox has a 20-2 record with five shutouts to lead the OUA. The Gaels will have to work to create opportunities against her.\r\n\r\nThe Gaels will be in a battle for bronze Sunday against a talented Laurier squad. Their run is not miraculous and their underdog status has only acted as encouragement for the team. Queen’s will be on the ice tomorrow looking to prove themselves as they have time and time again this year. \r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 13:01:24-04	2011-03-13 03:53:03-04	2011-03-13 03:53:03-04	t
304	Queen's underdogs can't kill McGill	33	queens-underdogs-cant-kill-mcgill	595		<!--image:"gaelswhockey2-1"-->\r\n\r\n<em>The Queen's Journal's Kate Bascom, Justin Tang and Lauri Kytomaa are in Waterloo, Ontario this weekend, covering the Gaels' bid for the CIS championship.</em>\r\n\r\nBy Lauri Kytömaa\r\nAssistant Sports Editor\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s Gaels finally met their match on Saturday as they faced up against the number one seed McGill Martlets in the second game of the CIS round-robin. While the story of the postseason for the Gaels had been resilience under deficits, there would be no coming back against the Martlets who have yet to lose a game in 26 games this season. Nevertheless the Gaels put up a valiant effort against the Goliath that has outscored its opponents 94-25, falling 3-1 in regulation.\r\n\r\nThe Martlets opened up the scoring quickly in the first period suggesting that the game could very well spiral out of the Gaels’ control. A penalty on Queen’s defenceman Katie Duncan just 55 seconds into the period provided McGill just the room it needed to slide a puck under goaltender Mel Dodd-Moher’s pads and take a one to nothing advantage. \r\n\r\nThe first strike failed to deter the Gaels as they battled back and forward Kelsey Thomson scored an unassisted goal 9:34 into the period. The score was tied at the end of the first but other statistics still suggested a discrepancy: for one the shots were 16-7 in favour of McGill.\r\n\r\nPenalty calls certainly factored into this difference between the teams. In the first period the Gaels took four infractions while the Martlets took three, but in the second only the Gaels would be called on violations. McGill was able to take the lead on a power play 5:30 into the second frame. The goal provided them just the surge of momentum they needed to break things up. Under three minutes after this go-ahead goal was scored, they potted another goal to take a 3-1 lead over the Gaels. \r\n\r\nAs the second period approached its close, even more disheartening signs showed for the Gaels. With 2:42 left in the period, Thomson, the team’s lead scorer in the regular season, was hit with a puck and stumbled limply to the bench. She would return to the game but her speed seemed to take a hit for the rest of the game. Also about a minute after Thomson fell down, a McGill player checked forward Brittany McHaffe straight into the boards from behind, right in front of the referee: no call.  \r\n\r\nThe Gaels entered the third period with a two-goal deficit. Because each of the Gaels’ playoff games had come after trailing at some point in the game, head coach Matt Holmberg said the team couldn’t help but feel that they could do it again.\r\n\r\n“It’s funny we’re down 3-1 against McGill and the team’s still quietly confident,” he said. “We’ve just done it so many times. We just knew that we’re still in this, we still have a shot at this right to the last second.” \r\n\r\nThe team’s tempo was there, but they were simply outmatched by a confident McGill team. The physicality flared up for the Gaels. Holmberg said that the physicality was part of the plan all along.\r\n\r\n“I think that it was a part of our game plan to get on them physically,” he said. “Obviously we weren’t trying to do it to take a penalty but we certainly wanted to let them know that we were there and try to get in their face a little bit.”\r\n\r\nYet sustained time in the Martlet’s zone was hard to come by: the game ended 3-1, giving the Gaels their first loss of the 2011 playoff run. Gaels captain Michelle Hunt said that the Gaels didn’t leave anything on the table.\r\n\r\n“Losing is always disappointing but we gave it our all. I think overall our team played really well,” she said. “They’re a great team. They’re number one in the country. We had a game plan and I think we stuck to it. It was difficult with the penalties we had because they have a great power play.”\r\n\r\nTheir 1-1 CIS round-robin record will send them to the bronze medal game at 4:00 p.m. Sunday where they will face the Laurier Golden Hawks for the sixth time this season. Their last meeting was in the OUA semi-final where the Gaels swept them in two games that both went to double overtime. A win tomorrow could provide a bronze-lining for the Gaels’ OUA banner season.\r\n\r\n“It’s awesome especially for Queen’s,” Hunt said. “We gave it our all out there so we can’t take anything away from that. It’s been a great season.”\r\n\r\n<em>Please visit <a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/blogs/Rejects/2011/03/hockey-saturday/">The Rejects Blog</a> for more photos from Justin Tang at the CIS Championships.</em>\r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 13:01:33-04	2011-03-13 03:10:31-04	2011-03-13 03:10:31-04	t

300	Gaels beat Pandas in Waterloo	33	gaels-beat-pandas-in-waterloo	595		<!--image:"gaelswhockey2"-->\r\n\r\n<em>The Queen's Journal's Kate Bascom, Justin Tang and Lauri Kytomaa are in Waterloo, Ontario this weekend, covering the Gaels' bid for the CIS championship.</em>\r\n\r\nThe Gaels played their first game of the CIS championship round-robin Friday afternoon against the Alberta Pandas. The Gaels grabbed their first lead in the playoffs with a goal by forward Liz Kench but the Pandas came back to tie the game in the second. The game was won in a shootout. Forward Kelsey Thomson was the lone scorer. \r\n\r\nHead coach Matt Holmberg said the Gaels started the game a little bit nervous.\r\n\r\n“It was our first championship playing against the defending champions,” he said. “Maybe there were some nerves. As we calmed down and weathered the storm, particularly after we got that goal we realized that we were in this game and we had a chance to win it.” \r\n\r\nThe Gaels are playing in a round-robin format the championship. Their pool includes the Alberta Pandas and the McGill Martlets. Queen’s has faced neither team and prepared for the tournament by focusing on their own game. \r\n\r\n“We decided that the best thing to do in our scenario is to do nothing different,” Holmberg said. “Try to do everything exactly the same or as close to the same as we’ve been doing during this streak. Just stick to the routine.”\r\n\r\nThe game went to overtime after Alberta scored on a five-on-three in the second period. With that tying goal, the Gaels were heading to their sixth straight game to go beyond regulation. The Gaels had only been involved in four shootouts during the regular season, coming out on top only once.\r\n\r\n“We do practise shootouts for fun every week,” Holmberg said.” With the way that Mel’s been playing and with the shooters that we have, we were pretty optimistic that we’d have a good result.”\r\n\r\nHolmberg went with his fifth-years, forwards Liz Kench, Becky Conroy and Thomson, in the shootout. \r\n\r\n“They’re the vets,” he said. “You’ve got to go with the players that got us here ... Those three have been a part of this team for five years and have been producing amazing numbers and they want to go. They want the opportunity to end the game.” \r\n\r\nGoaltender Mel Dodd-Moher faced 35 shots from Alberta and shut down all three Pandas in the shootout. She said the Gaels faced a different style of play from competition outside the OUA.\r\n\r\n“Definitely a different calibre,” she said. “They had a lot of good shots, a lot of nice plays ... Most of us were pretty excited just because in the OUA you only play 10 teams or so. It was nice to switch it up.”\r\n\r\nThomson remarked on the Gaels’ penchant for marathon games this postseason and the switch to a shootout.\r\n\r\n“We were obviously a little nervous,” she said. “We’re used to playing a couple periods of overtime and the shootout kind of forced it but it’s okay, it came out in our favour.”\r\n\r\nThomson, who scored the winner in the shootout, said her shot against the Alberta goaltender was a bit lucky. \r\n\r\n“I was coming down and I usually deke but I looked up and the goalie was so far back in her net that I just kind of flipped it in the last second,” she said. “It happened to kind of go off her shoulder and top corner.”\r\n\r\nThe Gaels face the McGill Martlets tomorrow at 4 p.m.\r\n\r\n<em>Please visit <a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/blogs/Rejects/2011/03/hockey-friday/">The Rejects Blog</a> for more photos from Justin Tang at the CIS Championships.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 13:02:47-04	2011-03-11 23:30:52-05	2011-03-11 23:30:52-05	t

To summarize it, he began with a salute to his veteran grandfather and then branched out to a number of different topics including the US government's support of Pinochet's regime in Chile, civilian casualties in Iraq, the Rwandan genocide and the "injustice of desecrating Palestinian Towns".\r\n\r\nObviously, reactions were divided. Some supported Day for putting the spotlight on these issues and speaking his mind, but mostly the response was negative. Maclean's <a href="http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2010/11/11/queens-remembrance-day-soapbox/">posted a criticism of the speech on their On Campus blog</a> and Queen's Israel on Campus <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/42386769/Queen’s-Israel-on-Campus-Statement-re-Nick-Day-s-Remembrance-Day-Remarks">released a rebuttal</a>.\r\n\r\nA motion was tabled that night at AMS Assembly to censure Day for using his position to speak personal views that don't represent his constituency. <a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2010-11-12/news/rector-reprimanded/">The motion passed 14-10 with 11 abstentions.</a>\r\n\r\nThat motion was brought to Assembly by Craig Draeger as a student-at-large. Draeger is also a leader of the Campus Conservatives (and an editor here at the <em>Journal</em>), who have led the latest charge against Day.\r\n\r\nThis week, after Michael Ignatieff <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/newsroom/news-release/statement-liberal-leader-michael-ignatieff-israeli-apartheid-week/">denounced Israeli Apartheid Week</a>, Nick Day wrote a letter in response, and <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/news/2011/03/response-michael-ignatieff-his-statement-about-israeli-apartheid-week">posted it on the ultra-liberal Rabble.ca</a>.\r\n\r\nThis time it's not just a censure—<a href="http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10150414629045375&id=657890374">it's an impeachment</a>.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"nickday-craigfbook"-->\r\n\r\nThe <a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/03/09/rector-of-queens-university-celebrates-israeli-apartheid-week-declares-israel-guilty-of-genocide/">National Post</a> and <a href="http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2011/03/09/queens-rector-abuses-his-title-in-letter-to-ignatieff/">Maclean's</a> posted criticisms. Facebook and Twitter are ablaze. There's even a <a href="http://nickdazesweater.tumblr.com/">Tumblr blog</a> attempting to make a meme out of it:\r\n\r\n<!--image:"nickday-meme"-->\r\n\r\nRumour has it, a motion will be brought to Assembly tonight by the above parties to hold a referendum to impeach Day. Also, the <em>Journal</em> has learned that Day won't be attending tonight's Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut none of this compares to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/queensprincipal/status/45913541835894784">being called to the Principal's office</a>.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"nickday-woolf"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE (4:30 p.m.)</strong>: Ontario MPP Steve Clark called on John Milloy, minister of Training, Colleges and Universities to condemn Day's actions during question period at Queen's Park today.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>QUESTION PERIOD.  MARCH 10, 2011\r\nMr. Steve Clark: My question is for the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.\r\n\r\nYesterday, Nick Day, a student representative at Queen's University used his position as rector to accuse Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in a letter attacking your own federal leader. Will you condemn the comments of Mr. Day in writing in a letter to the chancellor and the board of trustees of Queen's University?\r\n\r\nHon. John Milloy: All members realize that on university campuses it's about finding a balance. We want to find a balance between the safety and security of students, along with providing an environment where individuals and groups can participate in debate and discussion on a wide range of issues that you and I may not agree with.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, as members know, the Legislature condemned anti-Semitism on our university campuses, especially in the form of Israel anti-apartheid week. Jewish students, as well as faculty, must be able to live, work and study at our universities without fear of discrimination or hatred and I know that all our institutions work hard to create that balance.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker (Hon. Steve Peters): Supplementary?\r\n\r\nMr. Steve Clark: Minister, you talk about us not agreeing, this House unanimously approved a motion by my friend, the member for Thornhill, to ban the prejudicial term Israeli Apartheid Week. All members of this House stood to condemn the word apartheid for what it is: hate-filled.\r\n\r\nNow a student representative is not only using the term, but accusing Israel of genocide in a letter to your own federal leader. Will you, along with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, condemn the actions of Mr. Day in a letter to the chancellor and the board of trustees? Will you do it?\r\n\r\nHon. John Milloy: Again, our government remains committed to fighting discrimination in all its forms. We have spoken out against anti-Semitism. We have very strong ties to the state of Israel. The Premier, of course, led a mission there earlier last summer.\r\n\r\nThis is about balance ...\r\n\r\nL093-1115-10 follows\r\n\r\n[Hon. John Milloy]\r\n\r\n... discrimination in all its forms. We have spoken out against anti-Semitism. We have very strong ties to the state of Israel. The Premier, of course, led a mission there earlier last summer.\r\n\r\nThis is about balance. This is about campuses maintaining the right of students and faculty to have discussions about issues that the member or I or anyone in this House may not agree with, and at the same time protecting the rights of students to be able to study in safety. It is a matter of finding that balance.\r\n\r\nI know from my regular meetings with university and college presidents that they work very hard to maintain that balance, and I have every confidence that these institutions will continue to provide the necessary environment for debate and discussion, and also for the safety and security of students.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE (5:20 p.m.)</strong>: After meeting with Nick Day this afternoon, Principal Woolf <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/principal/news/rectorday.html">posted the following on the Principal's News page</a>.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<h4>Meeting with Rector Day</h4>\r\n\r\n\tMarch 10, 2011\r\n\r\n\tThis afternoon, I met with Rector Nick Day to express my concerns about an open letter he wrote earlier this week to the federal Liberal party leader. He wrote the letter as Rector, and not as an individual citizen.\r\n\r\n\tThe University's position is that this was inappropriate.\r\n\r\n\tThe views in the letter are not the issue - agree or disagree, he is entitled to them - it's the context in which he communicated his personal opinion.\r\n\r\n\tMr. Day's views do not and should not be seen as being representative of those of the University or Queen's students.\r\n\r\n\tThe university has been contacted by students, alumni, and others, who believe Mr. Day should no longer have the privilege of holding this office.\r\n\r\n\tAs a student-elected representative, the Rector is answerable to Queen's student body. The issue is being discussed tonight at AMS Assembly.\r\n\r\n\tI take this situation very seriously and I will be monitoring developments. In our conversation, I asked Rector Day to consider the impact of his actions and take steps to separate his personal views from the university position he currently holds. I am hopeful he will do so immediately.\r\n\r\n\tDaniel Woolf\r\n\t</blockquote>	t	t	2011-04-03 13:05:51-04	2011-03-10 16:26:39-05	2011-03-10 16:26:39-05	t

295	Musings on a revolution: A teach in on the Egyptian Revolution in brief 	33	musings-revolution-teach-egyptian-revolution-brief	643		By Katherine Fernandez-Blance\r\nAssistant News Editor\r\n\r\n‘It’s hard to sleep when there’s a revolution going on,’ appears to be the sentiment echoed by many of us. I probably know equal numbers of people who were glued to their seats watching Al Jazeera’s live streaming that I do students who never bothered to inform themselves about the quick unraveling of the Egyptian revolution. \r\n\r\nLuckily, as Queen’s students, we are blessed with the ability to learn and question from some of the greatest thinkers of our university, and we have the choice of whether or not to remain ignorant about the state of global affairs. \r\n\r\nDana Olwan, professor of gender studies and Arabic, took this opportunity to put together a teach-in styled panel on Feb. 17th for students and professors alike to come together and learn about the Egyptian Revolution from six different angles.\r\n\r\n“Teach-ins are educational forums, held at times of political need and urgency. They combine academic and activist speakers,” Olwan said. “The first time I attended one was…when people were organizing against the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and I learned a lot.” \r\n\r\nOlwan said that she transformed her dining room into an Al Jazeera news headquarters over the past 14 days, and that the turnout at the Teach-in was a testament to how much our community sees itself as part of a larger society and world at large. \r\n\r\n“This is the first event I’ve ever organized where people say their coming on Facebook and actually show up, this is an important moment,” she said. \r\n\r\n The event, held in Chernoff Hall had people cramming into the aisles and standing in the back, unable to find seats at one of the most interesting and well-put together panel discussions I have attended at Queen’s. What follows is a condensed version of the main points of discussion amongst the six panelists. \r\n\r\nMohamed Bayoumi: Introduction to the Revolution’s causes\r\n\r\nMohamed Bayoumi, professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering began the panel with discussions of the reasons behind what he described as a revolution of massive proportions.\r\n\r\n“It is the third major revolution worldwide in terms of numbers, after the French and Russian, but it is the first nonviolent revolution,” Bayoumi said. “It is proving that non-violence can achieve results…it can topple a dictator and get rid that regime.”\r\n\r\nBayoumi outlined what he felt were some of the major grievances Egyptians had suffered with for over 30 years prior to Feb. 11th. \r\n\r\nHe said that Egypt’s emergency rule which essentially allows the government the right to charge or detain anyone they wish was one problem, which still hasn’t been addressed by the nation’s current military rule. \r\n\r\nRigged elections, curtailed freedoms such as the censorship of the media, and corruption were also areas Bayoumi said caused intense discontent among the Egyptian population.\r\n\r\n“[There were screwed priorities] with 1.4 million people working for the police. The money for security was way more than that for health and education,” Bayoumi said, adding that because most of the government had been controlled by business men, the majority of the population had not been properly served by governmental policies. \r\n\r\nBayoumi also criticized Mubarek and his regime for blindly following the American government, and for acting as a proxy nation for other governments to bring prisoners to be tortured. \r\n\r\n“The objective of the revolution can be summed up in three words: freedom, dignity and social justice. These are three areas that the current regime has failed miserably at,” Bayoumi said. \r\n\r\nKhaled Shaeen: Dates of note\r\n\r\nKhaled Shaheen acted as both a moderator of the panel and spoke about the timeline of events leading up to the Egyptian Revolution, as well as the Tunisian Revolution and further uprisings in other areas of the Arab world. \r\n\r\nParticular dates of interest were 1996 when Al Jazeera was formed, which Shaheen indicated was a strong shift away from state controlled media, as well as 2003 where the US invasion of Iraq created large anti-war protests throughout Egypt, though Mubarek was viewed as being aligned with US policy. \r\n\r\n2004 saw the first protests in Egypt calling an end to Mubarek’s reign, and the next year marked the rise of the Egyptian blogosphere, as well as Egypt’s first multi-party election, which was rigged in Mubarek’s favour. \r\n\r\nShaheen said that the next years saw accelerating protests from labor unions and ordinary citizens, and in June 2010, Egyptian blogger Khaled Saeed was killed, allegedly by Egyptian police.  Facebook movements followed, as did the Tunisian Revolution of January 14th. \r\n\r\n“Egypt is a young population suffering from a lack of freedom and a lack of economic opportunity,” Shaheen said. \r\n\r\nAdnan Hussain: The legacies of the 50s and 60s\r\n\r\nAdnan Hussain, professor of Islamic world history spoke next, and said that it was important to realize that the reasons for the revolution extended further than 30 years. \r\n\r\n“There are unfinished legacies that are being approached in new and dramatic ways,” Hussain said, referring primarily to the rise of the third world consciousness that occurred during the 1950s and 60s period of decolonization. \r\n\r\nHussain pointed to social and land reform as well as economic development as areas of a social agenda that sparked hope in the newly independent regions.\r\n\r\n“The popular mobilizations behind this were very quickly marginalized. It was a top down revolutionary moment that quickly turned into a repressive state,” he said. \r\n\r\nHussain contrasted this era with the present one in which there have been no clear leaders of the Egyptian revolution. He said that the people have realized that they don’t actually need the state, or at least the regime any more. Also unusual is the lack of Islamism in the movement. \r\n\r\n“It’s not to say that Egyptian people are any less pious…but the idea that Islam as the discourse for political solution has been resolved as obsolete for political events,” Hussain said. \r\n\r\nAriel Salzmann: Global solidarity for Egypt’s youth \r\n\r\nProfessor Ariel Salzmann of Islamic and world history spoke about the need for global solidarity with the Egyptian people.\r\n\r\n“The eyes of the entire world are looking, this event is not confined to the Middle East,” Salzmann said. \r\n\r\nMany of the panelists pointed out that the revolution has been a youth lead movement, and Salzmann said that this coincides with a global underclass.\r\n\r\n“They’re looking to a future that doesn’t exist…[the Revolution] has been a coming together…with a youthful face that speaks across the globe,” Salzmann said, adding that it’s important to remember that the strikes post-Revolution have not let up. \r\n\r\n“A single spark can light a prairie fire,” Salzmann quoted. \r\n\r\nNasser Saleh: A revolution through Twitter, Facebook and Google\r\n\r\nNasser Saleh, an Egyptian who wrote his master’s thesis on the role if information communication technology and democracy in the Middle East talked on the important role social media played in the Egyptian Revolution. \r\n\r\nHe displayed examples of Egypt’s state run media blatantly misrepresenting the reality of the revolution. Tahir Square at 9:45pm was shown to be peaceful and beautiful on state run television, meanwhile news coverage on networks like Al Jazeera and the BBC showed the reality of the protests. \r\n\r\nMost interestingly, Saleh posed the question of whether a revolution can be tweeted. A Facebook event calling for the revolution on Jan. 25th was created and had almost 100,000 people respond as ‘attending.’ \r\n\r\n“A Google map was linked to the group to show meeting places all over Egypt, and a Google document was created [to list the necessary logistics] necessary to bring about change,” Saleh said. “After the Revolution, a Google forum was created to discuss the future of Egypt.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how many revolutions in the world already had a date and time,” Saleh said. \r\n\r\nMohammed Abdou: Where next? \r\n\r\nMohammed Abdou, a phd candidate and self-described Muslim anarchist was notably more critical about the results of the Revolution than his co-panelists. \r\n\r\n“It’s not about seizing power, it’s about knowing what to do with the power seized after,” Abodu said, arguing as an anarchist against the nation state. \r\n\r\nAbodu was critical of the idea of democracy being implemented in the country, concerned with it existing as a Western import, a concept that he said has clearly been ineffective in our own society. He said that so long as a modern nation state exists within capitalism, equality cannot be achieved. \r\n\r\nAbodu posed more questions than answers in his discussion, asking what the political and ethical commitments the post-Revolutionary movement will base itself on. \r\n\r\n“I think it’s an incredible time to be alive, but it’s a time to be very cautious as well…there’s a degree of intellectualism that’s somewhat missing from the conversation,” Abodu said. “It’s our responsibility over here to try and establish and assist one another transnationally in our struggles because we seriously do have common struggles, and we can’t do it alone.”\r\n\r\nDana Olwan: Revolutionary fear, and why we need to fight it\r\n\r\nDana Olwan, the final panelist, spoke on fear being the underlying emotion behind the revolution.\r\n\r\n“We [in the West] hoped but did not believe that the revolutionaries of Tahir square would succeed,” Olwan began.\r\n\r\nShe said that fear on the conservative end primarily concerned the impact the revolution would have on Western foreign policy, particularly neoliberal economics, adding that it was important to realize who our fear served and what it served.\r\n\r\n“To fear the Egyptian revolution today is to signal to Egyptians that their lives are less important than yours and mine,” Olwan said, calling for solidarity instead of fear of what a couple weeks or months of uncertainty would cause Egypt. \r\n\r\n“To fear it is to subscribe to the idea that certain humans are destined to live under tyrannical rule, while others can pursue equality and democracy,” she concluded. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor full audio coverage of this Teach-In, see:  http://radio613.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/a-teach-in-on-the-egyptian-revolution/	t	t	2011-05-28 19:24:16-04	2011-02-25 21:04:08-05	2011-02-25 21:04:08-05	t

Some form of caramel/brownie cheesecake (courtesy of CoGro) was brought, and members of Board swarmed excitedly. Safiah delegated the slicing of the cake, and 30 minutes later Board began!\r\n\r\n2. There was an emergency meeting of the Academic Planning Task Force earlier in the week. Details were not given.\r\n\r\n3. Figures from CoGro and TAPS sales were given. CoGro is leading at a 50% increase since last year, and TAPS has an 18% increase in sales since last year.\r\n\r\n4. There's a push for a 3-year rather than 5-year strategic plan. After meeting with stakeholders, four main points were proposed for the plan: professionalism, profitability, understanding and expanding the market of the AMS services, and strengthening employee experience.\r\n\r\n5. The possibility of creating a quota for faculties such as Engineering who are usually less represented in the AMS was discussed. Some worried that this would promote further faculty divide.   	t	t	2011-05-28 19:25:06-04	2011-02-10 20:09:25-05	2011-02-10 20:09:25-05	t

263	Starfish	32	starfish	548		It’s about three AM, and there’s someone in your bed.\r\nMaybe you’re dating this person.\r\nMaybe you don’t even know their name.\r\nMaybe you’re both covered in sweat and an inch-thick coating of cranberry sauce.\r\nIn any case, who they are--or how they got there--is none of my business.\r\nMy question is: are they staying the night?\r\n\r\nI’ve never known one topic to be as immediately divisive as the question of sleeping over--or not.\r\nSome of my friends refuse to share a mattress with anyone, under any circumstances. For them, the thought of even the largest shared bed evokes only nightmarish memories of hogged blankets, unforgiving elbows and snoring that resurrected Christ.Their partners--long-term or otherwise--have to acknowledge that under no circumstances will there be big-spooning, little-spooning, or any other spoon-related configuration. \r\nIn short, they’re <i>forked</i>.\r\n\r\nI guess it’s one thing to have a serious issue with sharing a bed under any circumstances. \r\nBut I find it pretty troubling that some people use this as an excuse to get themselves out of seeing someone once the sun is up--let alone actually having a conversation. \r\nHow is skulking home in the small hours of the morning any less of a “walk of shame” than doing so the next day? Some people go the other way entirely. For them, sharing a bed--for the whole night--is the main event, and it’s at least as important as anything else they might be doing with someone in that overnight timeframe. \r\n\r\nCall me old-fashioned, but I think it’s nice that some people still appreciate physical proximity in the simplest sense. I have great empathy for these people. Trying to find someone for a sleep-over, not pillow talk is a time-consuming process, and it’s one fraught with difficulties. When you’d prefer a shared bed, having all the space you want sometimes feels like too much space entirely. \r\n\r\nThe best way to sleep if you’ve got your bed to yourself is to take up all the available space. Spread out as far as you can with each limb, and reach for every corner--in a starfish shape. If the whole bed is yours, why share?My friends find this immensely comforting. There’s something gratifying about the knowledge that the whole bed is yours, that you can have all the blankets and pillows, and that your snoring--if you are so afflicted--will offend no one. \r\n\r\nFor maximum hedonism, try doing this face down. Suddenly, it feels like you’re sinking into a giant, cushiony embrace--it’s really quite marvellous. I call this the bed starfish, and I’ve never heard anyone say anything negative about it. \r\nTired of sleeping on your side, on one side of your bed?\r\n<b>Starfish</b>.\r\nFed up with the sense of empty space in your box-spring?\r\n<b>Starfish</b>.\r\nNeed to find an echinoderm that can regenerate limbs?\r\n<b>Starf</b>--you get the idea.\r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 17:38:58-04	2010-10-23 17:26:27-04	2010-10-23 17:26:27-04	t

"You need a reason for people to go to that Facebook page."\r\n\r\nMatheson: "It's imperative that we incorporate citizen input" not only at election time and regardless of age.\r\n\r\nChalmers: "There are so many bylaws on the books that are not being enforced." and that the city its own "worst enemy" re: Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n"Don't expect city hall and the councillors to do what you want then to do." Students need to provide input.\r\n\r\nNext question is in regard to diversity and making Kingston a more attractive destination for aboriginal and international students.\r\n\r\nLast: "How do we keep students here?" Supporting the arts community.\r\n\r\nLavalley: Make it easier for groups to hold public events like a parade. "Make it more accessible to showcase their lifestyle."\r\n\r\nMatheson: "Ever since I got to council I've been pushing to hold a multicultural festival like the one we just held."\r\n\r\nChalmers: "We have a very small group of diverse people in the city and we need to expand that group."\r\n\r\n"We need to bring more jobs to retain these students."\r\n\r\nGerretsen: "I think Kingston is a very diverse city."\r\n\r\nHe cites the recent 211 service and the necessity to make services available, as valuable assets for new Kingstonians.\r\n\r\nMatheson: "More cultural input" from aboriginal community.\r\n\r\ninclusion?\r\nNext question re: Gerretsen pltfrm: Why Is social inclusion measured by the city via crime rates? How does the city ensure social\r\n\r\nGerretsen: "There are difficulties with respect to measuring it" and that the city needs to develop a system of measuring inclusion.\r\n\r\nMatheson: "there's a differed dynamic in every group and we as a city need to be inclusive" especially with mental issues and age issues.\r\n\r\nQuestion for Ben Hartley, AMS VP-Operations: "Will you commit to having online voting at least available for the next election?"\r\n\r\nMatheson: Council is already working on it, he also wants preferential voting.\r\n\r\nGerretsen, Lavalley, Last and Chalmers also agree.\r\n\r\nLast: Every student will pay for Internet access. Caveat: security.\r\n\r\nQ from  Safiah Chowdhury, AMS President: How do you deal with the growing student population in Kingston?\r\n\r\nMatheson: Improve public transit and infrastructure, provide housing and especially affordable housing.\r\n\r\nM: Lakefront bike path.\r\n\r\nChalmers: We need better transportation. "are getting limited with what we can do inside the student area" need to make housing off-campus\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Promote density. Will save the downtown core.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: transit possibilities: Express routes and build based on "want" in addition to necessity.\r\n\r\nLast: "density is the answer downtown."\r\n\r\nLavalley: Were losing amenities in the downtown core. Ie No Frills. Amenities encourage students to move closer to core.\r\n\r\nQ: "Point out a unique quality that make them the ideal candidate for the position."\r\n\r\nChalmers: Independent business man and "I don't owe any special interest groups in this city anything."\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Bring new jobs. Kingston is booming in the renewable energy sector.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: make recycling available to all and build more sports facilities.\r\n\r\nLast: Youth.\r\n\r\nLavalley: Experience living paycheck to paycheck in Kingston, under the poverty line.\r\n\r\nMatheson: "anybody who knows me wouldn't call me politician" and seeing the need for change in the government.\r\n\r\nMatheson: Citizen involvement and taking the input of neighbors.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Cites his "controversial" Lake Ontario Park plan and his ability to get 12 out of 13 councilors to agree on it.\r\n\r\nQuestion about attracting jobs.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Bringing the jobs, something KEDCO can't do on their own.\r\n\r\nMatheson: Grow the talent we have within the city, to attract employers.\r\n\r\nChalmers: "We need more than just jobs, we need careers." can't just advertise, we need to "step out" and incentivize.\r\n\r\nQuestion about Aberdeen. What are your ideas to resolve the issue?\r\n\r\nLast: An attitude needs to be pushed farther into the ground. If we have Homecoming, we will have celebration.\r\n\r\nLast: More resources like Red Hats to ensure it's safe.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Were not giving the students enough to do. Would support a sanctioned event perhaps "on the scale of bluesfest"\r\n\r\nMatheson: We have to provide a "carrot and the stick methodology" and allow alternative events.\r\n\r\nChalmers: We need to work with the schools. Find a place to help welcome students to the city.\r\n\r\nChalmers: "Aberdeen wouldn't have happened if we stepped on it the beginning."\r\n\r\nGerretsen: This is not a new problem. We need to continue enforcement and the cancellation, because of the dwindling numbers.\r\n\r\nQuestion: say one good thing about another candidates platform.\r\n\r\nLavalley and Matheson agree on transportation.\r\n\r\nMatheson and Chalmers agree on the "direct line" approach to citizen engagement.\r\n\r\nChalmers: It would be unfair to pick only one, says they agree on a lot.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: I agree with the three younger candidates platforms based on sturdent awareness.\r\n\r\nLast: Matheson is the right person for transportation and Chalmers is valuable as an outsider, like himself.\r\n\r\nQuestion from Ben Hartley on behalf of Brandon Sloan: How do we preserve Queen's tradition of non-academic discipline.\r\n\r\nMatheson: NAD is valuable and utilized when legal action isn't deemed sufficient.\r\n\r\nChalmers: thinks fines are suitable and the University should not step in.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: The university should definitely step in. Most students would take a public intoxication ticket and "frame it on their wall"\r\n\r\nLast: RMC is an example of effective discipline, not that Queen's should take that lead but they should exercise student policing.\r\n\r\nLast: Students feel a kind of immunity when living in he student community.\r\n\r\nLavalley: Queen's should stick to their guns. Ultimately s legal issue.\r\n\r\nQuestion from  Safiah Chowdhury: given students' unique needs, what in your platform relates to them and why vote for you?\r\n\r\nChalmers: Once Queen's students are here, they have rights as citizens. Other citizens have poor views on students.\r\n\r\nBut they need to step up too and show that their not "bad people" and we need to look at things in a different light.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: we need to engage students in the process and use students to deliver the message back to the student body.\r\n\r\nLast: My entire platform relates to students. There won't be a change in behaviour until students get involved.\r\n\r\nLavalley: We need to be grabbing students out of their seats and asking them what they want from their community.\r\n\r\nMatheson: Engage our youth in the process of developing their dreams and aspirations for the community. Change our thinking.\r\n\r\nQuestion about improving cityofkingston.ca\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Establish a mayoral Twitter and Facebook to enable input from citizens.\r\n\r\nLast: "I grew up in a town of 500 people in Nova Scotia that had a better website than Kingston."\r\n\r\nLavelley: Put the city plans at the forefront and create a blog.\r\n\r\nMatheson: It should be more interactive and more usable. Live streaming of council meetings.\r\n\r\nChalmers: Totally different change. Sections for each counsellor, ability to make comments on upcoming decisions.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Clear distinction between political content and government. Live stream meetings.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Kingston is the second worst run magazine according to Maclean's.\r\n\r\nLast: more transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nLavalley: the council spends too much time in minutiae.\r\n\r\nMatheson: important that Kingston have a full-time mayor to deal with issues personally.\r\n\r\nQuestion about prison farms: Why no voice from local representation?\r\n\r\nLavalley: participated in protests. Unfortunately out of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nLast: it happened at a higher level. However just because it's outside of citys hands, doesn't mean we can't be vocal.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Great opportunity if the city can take over land and use that land for educating young people.\r\n\r\nChalmers: Some outcry from the city might have helped.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Gerretsen, would you be a full-time mayor?\r\n\r\nMatheson: Yes I will be a full-time mayor, at every meeting.\r\n\r\nChalmers: Need to work with staff.\r\n\r\nGerretsen: Yes I will be a full-time mayor, creating consensus.\r\n\r\nLast: Yes, going from a "$10.25 an hour job, I wouldn't do too bad with $86,000"\r\n\r\nLavalley: Will continue schooling but devote the proper time.\r\n\r\nClosing statements: Matheson: Think globally, act locally. These are trying times and this election is important.\r\n\r\n"I'll be the leader that can bring people together." We have to think outside the box.\r\n\r\nLavalley: I'm in this race to represent a group of people who don't necessarily speak up. I speak because I have passion for these issues.\r\n\r\nLast: By coming to the debate you haven't engaged, you need to ask us questions and see our answers. You have to be involved.\r\n\r\nStudents need to vote. "They never do and it's infuriating."\r\n\r\nGerretsen: We need to figure out together how to tackle future challenges.\r\n\r\nChalmers: I'm not a politician, I'm a business man. We need a business approach to running this city. Take the consideration of all.\r\n\r\nWe are all shareholders in the city, that's the accountability and transparency. Residents need to step up and voice their opinions.\r\n\r\nThat's it for the Mayoral Debate. Look for a full story in the Journal next week.	t	t	2011-04-03 17:00:45-04	2010-10-08 01:27:37-04	2010-10-08 01:27:37-04	t
290	Election Confetti	33	election-confetti	643		<strong>By Carlee Duchesne, Advertising Representative </strong>\r\n\r\nYear after year, three-letter acronym after three-letter acronym, the AMS elections take over not only the minds of the Queen's student population, but also their hallways.\r\n \r\nI don't know when it started, but handing out small leaflets with your team's name and the three inspirational words that envelop your campaign has definitely become the trend. Personally, I don't find small, brightly coloured handouts informative or persuasive, and if anything I think they can be conceived as more annoying than helpful. Our current world is filled with alternative routes of advertising and information sharing, many of which don't rely on the mass consumption of paper (the majority of which end up on the ground or shoved in between chairs in the lecture halls). So then, why do these teams feel the need to ambush your fellow peers as they make their way to and from class?\r\n \r\nYesterday I was walking back from class through Mac-Corry, minding my own business, talking on the phone when I was approached by a team (no need to reveal which one, since they all seem to have the same tactics) who decided that relaying their information to me was more important than my phone call. This information was deemed so necessary that they were willing to bypass actually handing it to me (which implies consent on my part) and instead shoved their leaflet between my hand and my phone. So I was left, slightly dumbfounded, walking through campus still talking on the phone and now with the added joy of a leaflet precariously sticking to the side of my head.\r\n \r\nI am all for self-promotion and having actually read some platforms from candidates in various positions I think that there are some great leaders and really wonderful ideas out there. However, just as you would probably be annoyed if someone on the street was shoving copies of their newspaper into your hand as you made your way through downtown, some of us are annoyed by the incessant need for you to get your colourful piece of paper into our hands while we are casually making our way to class.\r\n \r\nIf we are interested in learning more about your campaign, we will come talk to you at your booths and if we seem uninterested then don't take it personally, we probably have a lot of other things on our mind. There are many other avenues available where I can educate myself on your campaign platform, your goals and your promises - so please save me, and the environment, and stop with the election confetti. \r\n\r\n\r\n<em> Do you have something to say about the 2011 AMS elections?

288	Video Overload	33	almost-hypnotizing	684		This year's AMS executive election is beginning to look more like a battle of the videos. <a href="http://www.voteces.com/" target="_blank">Team CES</a> (Morgan Campbell, Ashley Eagan, Kieran Slobodin) posted another campaign video earlier today. \r\n\r\n<iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="450" height="365" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tEYrXa0atjw" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nI'm all for incorporating different types of media into a campaign strategy, but when it comes to creativity and content, I have yet to be impressed by what either team has offered.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpii6H4eU6o" target="_blank">Team SDL's "Must be SDL" musical parody</a> tells me absolutely nothing about their platform or the qualifications of the candidates. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssuuN6rKonc"  target="_blank">Team CES's photo montage</a> is a touch more creative, but still lacks any real informative content. And their latest creation is so repetitive it's borderline annoying.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, if I'm going to spend three minutes of my time watching all of these videos online, they better be entertaining. Watch Mike Moll, UBC's AMS presidential candidate, in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZfOVfvaPsI" target="_blank">brilliant parody of the famous Old Spice commercials</a>. Or the impressive show of support in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gr2zjwdm5I" target="_blank">Emily Rowe's video</a> for her presidential campaign at the University of Western Ontario (she later on went to win by a landslide). \r\n\r\nGranted, student leader hopefuls at other schools may be able to benefit from established film programs or more technical resources. But the examples put forth by Mike Moll or Emily Rowe make Team CES and Team SDL's efforts look amateurish in comparison. \r\n\r\nDon't make videos for the sake of having one. Make a video if you have something to communicate and you can use the technology effectively to do so. Frankly, I think the effort and time that was spent putting these videos together would have been better allocated to other elements of the campaign. \r\n\r\nThere are five days left in the campaign period. Let's hope the next Youtube link from either of the teams proves me wrong. \r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 17:07:12-04	2011-01-26 19:28:15-05	2011-01-26 19:28:15-05	t
248	Slammed! By Catriona Ward Sell	27	slammed-by-catriona-ward-sell	456		<!--image:"slam"-->\r\n“I’m Harry Giles. And I hate my cock.”\r\n\tThe words which heralded my entrance into slam poetry were certainly memorable. Encouraged by St Andrews University’s creative writing club to attend, I couldn’t help feel slightly out of place as I was confronted by a guy rapping about a turbulent relationship with his genitalia. In fact, I had remembered uncomfortably, the main lure for me was that a fantastic American comedy quartet promised to perform during the interval.\r\n\tI am pleased to say that my opinion of slam poetry has developed positively since then - both because of, and beyond, the next 2 minutes of Harry Giles’ rap. Recently asked the question of “what is a poetry slam?”, I failed to come up with a concrete definition. It is competitive poetry. Each competitor has a set time in which to perform - usually, around three minutes. Often, the winner of each round is determined by a team of judges and the audience. The “finalists” get to participate in a “slam off”, scoring points for writing, performance, and audience reaction. During my short time as a slam poet, I have heard many different styles of slam poetry: from students with beautifully polished lyrics incorporating lighting and music, to “Rapunzel Wizard” - a man with a foot-long beard, who waddled on stage, squatted down, and rapped about constipation. Neither won. The champion was a balding businessman who simply announced his titles and read. His poems were powerful. He spoke of war and oil in the first two, before changing his tone to hilariously - but friendlily - mock rappers. Having brought along what must have been most of his colleagues to cheer him on, they raised the roof, securing his path to victory. \r\n\tSlam poets generally perform their own material, though it is not unknown to borrow another’s work. Classic works, such as John Donne’s sonnets, have been given great voices in public performance. The freedom to passionately express oneself has led to the slam’s involvement in political and civil rights movements. Often, it is not the most elaborate performance which creates the winning piece, but the truth, passion or humour of the writing. Members of the audience may be selected to act as impartial judges, although the crowd’s reaction always sways the voting. When it gets down to the final round, the audience alone may become the judge, with a show of hands or secret vote determining the winner.  \r\n\tWith an active creative writing scene at Queen’s, the slam should naturally be brought to Kingston. On the 26th of March, the Grad Club is hosting its first poetry slam. Hosted by Jill Battson, this will not be a gentle ease into the shallow waters of Slam Poetry. It will feature a performance by The Sharp Tongues (a slam team from Toronto), Lara Bozabalian (an international slam competitor and author of The Cartographer’s Skin), Krystle Mullin, and Amanda Hiebert. To top off the night, the public are invited to compete in a slam for a monetary prize (and significant boasting rights). For those not wishing to compete, audience participation is guaranteed - in voting, judging, cheering, finger-snapping…and possibly to join the poets in propping up the bar afterwards.\r\n\tYou are thus invited to sharpen your writing skills, polish your performance, and gather your screaming fans to descend upon the Grad Club. Whether you want to rap, guitar in hand, to start a civil rights movement, read from the page, or just listen to the poets perform, it promises to be a great night. Hopefully, as at St Andrews, such a night will kick off a permanent and exciting Slam tradition here. And although it may not be wrapped up with lines quite as emphatic as Harry Giles’ “…and I just want a fuck, but by penis - he wants love”, it will be a memorable night.

284	Antigone reborn	27	antigone-reborn	643		I fear the adaptation of classic work to modern theatre. Too often, the morality of a traditional script is lost in wayward attempts at making contemporary that which was not written to be.\r\n\r\nVagabond Theatre’s Antigone quelled any fears I had on the issue. I was immediately swept by a stellar cast in which no actor lacked presence or punch. Antigone, a Sophoclian tragedy, tells the story of a whimsical young woman pushing against her royal roots in civil unrest. The princess is perturbed by her brothers’ recent death, and stubborn in defying the King Creon’s orders to forget wholly of such loss. The play ends miserably, with the death of Antigone and her fiancé Haeman, a testament to misguided happiness and power’s corruption. \r\n\r\nRuth Goodwin, who acts the title role, filled each scene with well-executed passion and a natural innocence. Goodwin’s facial expressions— from furrowed brow to wide-eyed wonderment— were perfectly characteristic of Antigone’s free-spirited nature.  Quick-witted articulation made Goodwin a standout even among the talented cast. From  the height of tension to lowest lovers’ cradle, the chemistry between Goodwin and her on-stage love, Ryan Armstrong, is spell-binding. Armstrong further flexes his acting chops in the performance’s climax, a moment of electrifying passion and anger. \r\n\r\nOne-man chorus Graham Bonville also stood out for his well-timed narration of Antigone. Adrian Young, who acts as the conflicted King Creon, made the script come to life with a hearty voice, punctuated by sweeping hand gestures and great facial expressions. \r\n\r\nIt must be said that the venue posed some obvious issues in Antigone. Hosted in the basement of Princess Street’s The Mansion, the cramped bar was difficult to disguise as theatre. Lines of candle-lit mason jars framed a gothic-style brick wall— this lighting initially cast a soft glow over each scene, but soon came to cause issue when characters were blocked in dark corners. When cast members held candles deliberately, a symbol of each character coming to life, the lighting was effective. Otherwise, it cast shadows onto faces which require extra light to be effective. As a technical detail, heavier makeup would perhaps have helped to distinguish expression. \r\n\r\nDirector Nathaniel Fried described his venue as being an exciting challenge, and it is clear that his efforts best utilized a difficult choice for theatre. The performance was meant to be an intimate cast-audience experience, but became difficult when the audience was required to move room-to-room for some scenes. The transitions were well orchestrated by Bonville, but it was distracting to move during such an enthralling show. Notably, the cast worked very well with audience members and moved nimbly around people sitting on set.\r\n\r\nAn extremely well-acted performance which flawlessly adapts classic script to modern society, Antigone left me emotionally absorbed in each character’s theatrical world. It is a winter must-see for fans of classical theatre.\r\n\r\n<strong>Antigone runs January 21-23, 28-30, 2011 in The Mansion Wine Cellar at 506 Princess St.</strong>	t	t	2011-04-03 17:09:34-04	2011-01-23 18:31:26-05	2011-01-23 18:31:26-05	t
283	Features - Recycling Ride-along	35	features-recycling-ridealong	502		There are only a few things nowadays that might compel me to wake up before the crack of dawn and venture out into a snowstorm. A very unique photo assignment had me rolling out of bed at a quarter to six and fumbling for my warmest clothes and a mug of tea on the morning of January 12, 2011. \r\n\r\nA garbage truck ride-along had been an idea that Features Editor Jake Edmiston and I had mulled over. With the story now a reality, I knew this assignment would either yield some interesting images or be a complete bust. \r\n\r\nI had several concerns, one of which was the amount of light. With a 6:15 a.m. wake-up time and sunrise at 7:39 a.m., I was worried that I would be shooting in pitch-blackness. The elements and the cold would also be a concern, since I would spend most of my time trudging through the snow beside the truck. I laid out my camera gear, extra sweaters, and set three alarm clocks. And despite my desire for sleep, my excitement kept me lying awake for longer than I would have liked. \r\n\r\nThe Ghetto was stirring slowly in the grey light by the time I returned home, utterly frozen and with a greater appreciation for the work that garbage and recycling collection workers do. I uploaded my images and promptly got back into bed, knowing that I had at least one image that I could be proud of. In retrospect, the assignment went quite well and I had several keepers.\r\n\r\nHere they are:\r\n\r\n<p></p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/content/2011/01/garbage-1-justin-tang.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="garbage1"> \r\nWaste collection personnel replace a garbage bin as snow continues to fall in Kingston. I fortuitously shot this image from the foyer of my home while waiting to rendezvous with Jake and our assigned recycling truck. Despite waking at 6:00 a.m., it would be an hour before we would meet. Playing the waiting game is incredibly difficult when it is both so early and so cold. \r\n\r\n<p></p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/content/2011/01/garbage-2-justin-tang.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="garbage2"> \r\nKyle Hannah empties a grey bin into his recycling truck at Johnson Street and Division Street on January 12, 2011.

The last two images are very similar and were shot seconds apart yet I can’t decide which I like more.

Jake, having spent most of his time in the cab, continued the ride-along with Hannah while I returned home to thaw out. If you haven’t yet checked out the new Journal layout or read Jake’s article, I would encourage you to do so. Special thanks to Kyle Hannah of the City of Kingston for being such a great subject and not objecting to the camera that was clicking in his face for an hour.\r\n\r\nAs always, there’s more to come on The Rejects. \r\n\r\nStay warm.	t	t	2011-04-03 17:08:33-04	2011-01-23 03:39:16-05	2011-01-23 03:39:16-05	t
282	The hidden gem of the limestone	27	the-hidden-gem-of-the-limestone	693		<!--image:"monuments-and-statues"-->\r\n\r\nGuitars can melt faces, but cellos melt hearts. This seems to be the driving force behind the Kingston-based band Monuments and Statues, a group that shirks the traditional rock ensemble for the likes of the banjo, cello and some excellent harmonies. \r\n\r\nThe five-piece group is comprised of Queen’s students of the past and present, one of which is a psychology master’s student and three of which are studying geology. While this certainly means they love rock(s), they strive for a sound that is more eclectic; a hybrid of pop, folk, classical and carrying undertones from whatever other genres they see fit. \r\n\r\nGeoff Reith, one of the Monuments’ three vocalists and their sole banjoist is also responsible for the bulk of the songwriting. He “creates the skeleton of the songs,” and says that the band collaborates to flesh out the rest of the song as they rehearse. \r\n“Because of our unusual instrument combinations it’s hard to say that we sound like any one particular band or ‘sound.’ We try to create each song as its own unique piece, and because of this our songs tend to be very diverse,” he said.  \r\n\r\nThis is substantiated by their lyrics that circulate around story-telling. Fictional places and events are often evoked, and you may notice a song about a ghost.\r\n\r\nInstead of being confined to a set genre, their style “evolved out of our … common goal of writing music that is both fun and intriguing,” the band said.\r\n\r\nMonuments and Statues recently released their four song EP <Welcome to the Undertow> for free from their website. The album has served to expand their audience and because of the small monetary investment involved in its recording, they decided to make it available for listening for no extra cost.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Kingston-based YGK records, the band is hoping to release a full-length album in the near future. Hoping for some studio time, the band will incorporate new material and fine-tune some of the songs they’ve been performing for years. \r\n\r\nThe band last recorded in a studio when they contributed a track to <Shelter Me>, a CD that fundraised for the Kingston Humane Society. \r\nBesides recording, they’ve also had a steady presence playing shows in and around the Queen’s campus.\r\n\r\n “Our first show was at Bar-None, (now The Spot) and we opened for one of our favourite bands, Mother Mother. … The Mansion and Clark Hall have [also] been very good to us, and we have had many good shows at both of those places,” they said.\r\n\r\nMonuments has also played at the Wolfe Island Music Festival and will attest that they had “a lot of fun.”\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that Monuments and States are all about having fun and putting on a great sonic show; another facet of their performance is fashion, and at a performance they once took a break between songs to debate the merit of jeggings.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject was broached, Geoff gave a thoroughly contemplated answer.\r\n\r\n “On one side you have the jean purists who will insist that pants should be completely in-elastic, whereas on the other hand one could argue that jeggings combine the unique comfort and style of leggings with the time-honoured visual aesthetic of denim,” he explained.\r\nThese wise words were contrasted with their preference of peanut butter over jelly. \r\n\r\n“In today’s hyper-allergenic world, it can be used both as a weapon and a delicious source of protein,” they said. \r\n\r\nIf you like catchy songs, stretchy denim and a fun time, come see them play. Even someone deathly allergic to peanuts will have to admit that there’s some inexplicably sexy about a girl playing cello. \r\n\r\n<strong>Monuments and Statues play tonight at Clark Hall Pub along with Bravestation and Dora Alexander. The free show starts at 9:00 p.m.</strong>\r\n	t	t	2011-04-14 08:17:18-04	2011-01-20 19:18:38-05	2011-01-20 19:18:38-05	t
281	Masterful Mikado	27	masterful-mikado	691		<strong>By Caroline Garrod, Staff Writer</strong>\r\n\r\nQueen’s Musical Theatre’s (QMT) production of <em>The Mikado</em> opened on Wednesday and was every inch the glorious comic masterpiece that Gilbert and Sullivan originally imagined.\r\n\r\n  W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan’s 1885 masterpiece, <em>The Mikado</em> tells the story of the love between Nanki-Poo, the undercover son of the Emperor of Japan (also known as The Mikado), and Yum-Yum, the lovely young ward of the Lord High Executioner, Ko-Ko. Their love story is complicated by Ko-Ko’s desire to marry Yum-Yum himself, and the fact that Nanki-Poo is already engaged to a woman who he loathes. Gilbert and Sullivan set the play in Japan so as to make fun of contemporary England; the resulting play has very little to do with Victorian Japan, but very much to do with Victorian England.  The entire performance buzzed with the sort of lively, spirited comic energy that a Gilbert and Sullivan musical demands. The orchestra was equally excellent; their beautiful music complemented the show impressively. The cast is to be commended for their dedication to hamming it up, even in mid-song and for their careful enunciation of Gilbert’s clever words. Alana Sargeant is adorable as the sweet eyelash-batting Yum-Yum, and Carl Jackson was deliciously droll as Poo-Bah, the pompous cartoon of Victorian aristocrats. Katie Hinchcliffe’s powerful voice lends great majesty to the cartoonish Katisha and Andrew Fraser’s sappy facial expressions brought Nanki-Poo to life.  The true star of the show was Peter Nielsen, who was completely delightful as the drippy, self-satisfied Ko-Ko. His physical realization of the character was impressive: it was impossible not to laugh as he flipped and flopped across the stage and contorted his face in exaggerated expressions. His Ko-Ko was every inch the cowardly, blustering bureaucrat that he should be. \r\n\r\n His delivery of the List Song (“As Someday It May Happen”) was the undeniable highlight of the show. The song, (which lists societal offenders who “never would be missed”), was modernized to great affect, and included such offending personages as fist bumpers, Homecoming vomiters, Justin Bieber’s hairstylist, the current government and the staff of The Queen’s Journal. The modernized song was met with much laughter and was a great decision on behalf of director Matt Stewart and the rest of the crew.  The delicate origami-esque set provided the perfect cartoonish, Oriental flavour to Gilbert and Sullivan’s anachronistic, romanticized Japan. The costumes were also excellent, contributing to the Oriental aesthetic without hindering the actors.\r\n\r\n  Despite the play’s 19th century origin, and QMT’s traditional interpretation of it, <em>The Mikado</em> is as fresh and witty as it was 126 years ago. One would never know that this production is by a university musical theatre group, as the performance is as polished and the cast as skilled as any professional theatre company.  This play is recommended to any fan of musicals, QMT, the witticisms of George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde and P.G. Wodehouse, or anyone who is simply looking for some cheap entertainment.   \r\n\r\n<strong><em>The Mikado</em> is playing tonight and tomorrow at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Grand Theatre. Tickets are $25 for adults and $18 for students.</strong> 	t	t	2011-04-03 17:15:53-04	2011-01-15 15:00:09-05	2011-01-15 15:00:09-05	t
280	Less to Study, More to Gain?	33	less-to-study-more-to-gain	643		<!--image:"studying"-->\r\n\r\nWelcome back to the grind, folks. The sort of student happiness brought about by this period of low scholastic demand is already beginning its decline in preparation for midterms, coming just around the corner. Zenhabits, a popular blog for holistic lifestyle, recently published a post discussing alternative study habits for the university student. Guest writer Scott H Young (http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) addressed the effectiveness of his own study habits, some that would send any avowed Staufferite into academic shock. Young claims that his five simple study tactics have fared well for his A to A+ average in university, but the risky method has all sorts of keener alarm bells sounding off in my brain. \r\n\r\nAs I am a poster child for classical study methods— read, write, review, repeat— Young’s rapid-learn style could not be more opposite to my own. He uses cognitive psychology to back his theories of effective learning, structured by five suggestions for study time: “metaphors and analogy”; “visceralization”; “the 5-year old method”; “diagramming”; and “storytelling to remember numbers and facts”. The system is based entirely upon Young’s key principle of connection over memorization. That is, bringing ideas together to form a cohesive whole instead of memorizing different concepts independently of the other. \r\n\r\n“Children are imaginative, creative and, in many ways, the epitome of this rapid learning strategy. Maybe it’s the current school system, or maybe it’s just a consequence of growing up, but most people eventually suppress this instinct.\r\nThe sad truth is that the formal style of learning, makes learning less enjoyable. Chemistry, mathematics, computer science or classic literature should spawn new ideas, connections in the mind, exciting possibilities. Not only the right answers for a standardized test.The irony is that maybe if that childlike, informal way of learning came back, even just in part, perhaps more people would succeed on those very tests. Or at least enjoyed the process of learning.” - Scott H Young in <a href="http://www.zenhabits.net/ace-exams/">How I was Able to Ace Exams Without Studying</a>.\r\n\r\n<em>Have you tried a method similar to Young’s and was it effective?

279	Huckleberry Finn to be censored in new edition	36	huckleberry-finn-be-censored-new-edition	643		<img src= "http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/mark-twain.jpg" alt ="Mark Twain"/>\r\n\r\nTen days ago the literary world was sent reeling over an announcement by NewSouth Books that Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn would see censorship in its newest edition. The word “nigger”, used 219 in the novel, will be replaced with “slave”. Alan Gribben, English department head at the Auburn University, put forward the idea to censor Twain’s classic so that it could be more readily accepted in schools across America. NewSouth hopes to have the censored editions printed for distribution by next month. See the full article <a href= "http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/45645-upcoming-newsouth-huck-finn-eliminates-the-n-word.html">here</a>.\r\n\r\nJournal staffers weigh in on NewSouth’s bold move below. Thoughts? Join the discussion by leaving a comment. <!--more-->\r\n\r\nOne issue I have with the replacement of what is obviously an offensive and derogatory word is the historical ramifications of changing an important piece of literature. Would the replacement of the word "nigger" with "slave" mean that students might fail to understand the racism of the time depicted in Huckleberry Finn? It may be that censored editions of the book mask the important lessons to be learned from reading the original version.\r\n\r\n-<strong>Clare Clancy</strong>, News Editor\r\n\r\nReplacing this word with another would place the historical context into a different perspective for readers. Readers who might want to read it, assuming historical accuracy, will not get the original perspective that the author intended. Changing the words would change the author's writing itself. It would be like taking the original version of Anna Karenina and changing the descriptive words used which were intended to be read in a particular way. It would also be changing the artistic intention of the author.\r\n\r\n-<strong>Labiba Haque</strong>, Assistant News Editor\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the merit of wanting classroom novels to be clean of such language, I question whether a move such as this could prove an even greater hindrance in students’ learning experience. How would a teacher present modified literature while speaking on the cultural, historical and social context in which it was written? Would an instructor address the replaced word, or would students be left unaware that there is a small piece of this literary work missing? It is an unfortunate thought that students may see a single word stand out more prominently than the bounty of genius which surrounds it in Mark Twain’s writing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Terra-Ann Arnone</strong>, Web and Blogs Editor\r\n\r\nEverything I could possibly say is <a href="http://tumblr.seoulbrother.com/post/2638856023/nigger">said better here</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>—Tyler Ball</strong>, Editor in Chief \r\n\r\nTo move away slightly from the literary or philosophical implications of changing the language, I'd like to examine this action's significance in the political-institutional realm. Specifically, I'd like to juxtapose it with another act of censorship, in order to try and gain some perspective. \r\n\r\nThe Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) recently banned the Dire Straits song "Money For Nothing" from airing on Canadian radio stations, due to the repeated use of the word "faggot." \r\n\r\nhttp://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/922477--money-for-nothing-ruling-makes-waves-on-radio\r\n\r\nI think it's necessary to draw a distinction between censorship that seeks to reduce choice and restrict public access to something (the CBSC ruling) and censorship that seeks to increase access to something by offering an altered version. \r\n\r\nAnd that's exactly what it's being presented as, an alternative: ' "I'm hoping that people will welcome this new option, but I suspect that textual purists will be horrified," [Gribben] said.' \r\n\r\nThe PW article states that the first NewSouth edition will print 7,500 copies, and makes no mention that any specific school district has requested it for use in the classroom. \r\n\r\nThose who oppose this edition's publishing have been steeping their arguments with the implication that it reduces choice. While it's clearly a case of censorship (the ethics of which are highly debatable), I'm not convinced that it reduces freedom for consumers to access the unaltered version, or that Twain's literary integrity is facing an existential threat.\r\n\r\n<strong>Craig Draeger</strong>, Opinions and Letters Editor\r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 17:15:30-04	2011-01-14 08:57:46-05	2011-01-14 08:57:46-05	t
278	Sports - Waterpolo	35	sports-waterpolo	502		The OUA Waterpolo championships were held at the ARC Pool on November 26th to 28th, 2010. The weekend looked to be incredibly busy for Journal photographers since Queen’s was fielding both men’s and women’s teams and the Athletics Department, as hosts of the tournament, had asked the Journal to provide photography for the bronze and gold games. I had never been to a waterpolo game, let alone covered one. I wasn’t sure what to expect.\r\n\r\nI quickly learned that waterpolo is a game of contrasts. The game is immensely physical, with hands and limbs frequently colliding and heads being pushed underwater. Most sports matches are quite noisy, with the shouts of athletes and the encouragement of spectators forming a cacophony.  Waterpolo is quiet, except for the constant splashing of water and piercing whistle blasts from referees. There is little yelling, little speaking, and very little celebration from the athletes at the end of plays: polar opposite from the women’s volleyball matches I covered the day before. \r\n\r\nI covered the Gaels men’s team in their attempt to make the finals and the women’s team in their drive for a bronze medal, as well as the women's gold medal game between Carleton and the University of Toronto. \r\n\r\nHere are my rejects from the OUA Waterpolo Championships. \r\n\r\n<p></p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/content/2010/12/waterpolo3-justin-tang.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="Waterpolo 3"> \r\nMcMaster’s Bryn Sutherland defends the ball from Queen’s player Judith Weist in the OUA bronze medal game on November 28th, 2010. The angles of the outstretched arms show the high level of physical agility that waterpolo players possess; the text on the ball is a nice touch. \r\n\r\n<p></p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/content/2010/12/waterpolo6-justin-tang.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="Waterpolo 6"> \r\nThe Toronto Varsity Blues score a goal against the Queen’s Gaels men’s waterpolo team on November 27th, 2010. The Gaels lost 23-0 to the Varsity Blues, eventually being eliminated from the tournament by the Western Mustangs later in the afternoon. \r\n\r\n<p></p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/content/2010/12/waterpolo2-justin-tang.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="Waterpolo 2"> \r\nGaels head coach Don Duffey reacts as the women’s team regroups following the end of the third quarter of the OUA bronze medal game.

Their outpouring of emotion was refreshing and very different from the tacit nature of the match. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it for now!

277	Sports - Women's Soccer	35	sports-womens-soccer	502		The Gaels’ women’s soccer team was the lone Queen’s varsity team left in any of the OUA playoffs. I wanted to cover the gold medal game but had been assigned to shoot the Liberal Party nominations at the K-Rock Centre. I still wanted to catch any part of the game if I could: this was a gold medal game and the stakes were high. High stakes typically means high emotions, which increases the chances for interesting photos.\r\n\r\nBy the time I arrived at Richardson Stadium, there were only a few minutes left in regulation time and the Gaels were now down a point. I snapped off a few frames, and the referee’s whistle marked the end of the game.\r\n\r\nWith a 1-0 final score and such evenly matched teams, the match’s story might have been less about the action on the field than what happened after the game. \r\n\r\nHere’s my take on winning and losing at the OUA’s.\r\n\r\n<p></p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/content/2010/11/soccer1-justin-tang.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="Soccer 1"> \r\nQueen’s defender Mikyla Kay regroups with her teammates as the Laurier Golden Hawks celebrate their OUA Championship win.

Jubilation and devastation. Flipsides. That’s what sports is all about.\r\n\r\nI’m only disappointed that I wasn’t able to shoot the CIS game.

276	Current - Civic Remembrance Day Ceremony	35	current-remembrance-day	502		I attended the Civic Remembrance Day ceremony in Kingston, Ontario on November 11th by Barrie and King Streets. Christine, the Journal’s Photo Editor, was covering the on-campus ceremony so I decided to go and make a few photos for myself.\r\n\r\nRemembrance Day is interesting in Kingston because of its large military population. I’ve never seen such a long parade of Canadian service-people and cadets.

We didn’t - and wouldn’t - run this photo: the subject isn't a Gael. As a campus newspaper, we need to report on our athletes first. Sadly, this leaves little room for images like this, even though this side of the story is the the flipside to the Gaels’ dominant victory.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!

273	Welcome	35	welcome	502		My name is Justin Tang and I am a photographer. This year, I am serving as the Assistant Photo Editor at the Queen’s Journal, following two years as a staff photographer.\r\n\r\nI’ve worn many hats in the seven or so years I’ve called myself a photographer. I’ve done sports, events, portraits, and even one wedding. Newspaper photography, although it can comprise any of these elements, is an entirely different animal. Why? Two words: real estate. There just isn’t enough of it to be able to print every relevant photo - or <em>any</em> irrelevant photo.\r\n\r\nAs a result, newspaper photography strips a story down to <em>the</em> key image or <em>the</em> key moment, and those alone. Don’t get me wrong: these are important images. They are necessary for us to tell the story accurately within the context of the paper. But they’re not the whole, complete story. And that is what I want to show with this blog.\r\n\r\nThis blog is entitled “The Rejects” to showcase the photographs that don’t tell <em>the</em> story. The photos that aren’t prototypical. The photos that break the rules and therefore don’t make the paper.\r\n\r\nI hope to also use this blog as a launching pad for different projects. Documentary-style projects. Mixing stills with audio, and maybe - just maybe - video. I want to look at some of the selects, the ones that made the cut, and dissect them. And I want to frame all of this through my philosophy of photography and my journey with the Journal.\r\n\r\nI’m excited.\r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 17:35:33-04	2010-11-24 13:00:00-05	2010-11-24 13:00:00-05	t

272	A Modest Proposal	34	modest-proposal	582		I've been thinking a lot about names recently. You see, I never liked my own name very much. For one thing, it has no history or special meaning to anyone—my mother picked it out of an issue of TV Guide. It also doesn't command any respect, or at least I wouldn't respect someone named Craig. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, I don't associate with it. When I think of myself—what I've done, who I am—I certainly don't think, "that's Craig."\r\n\r\nI don't even really know how to say it. A number of years ago, someone asked me if it was pronounced "Cr-egg" or "Cr-ay-g," and I had no idea what to tell them. I still don't. \r\n\r\nBecause of this disdain, I do everything possible to avoid it. I cringe when I have to identify myself on the phone, or when I'm meeting someone for the first time.\r\n\r\nI don't even like saying other people's names, since I irrationally assume they must dislike their name too. So I guess I've been projecting my own neuroses on other people.\r\n\r\nTo get around this problem, I typically address people by their chosen title—"Professor Jones," or "Doctor Johnson"—or by the rather anonymous "sir," or "ma'am."\r\n\r\nBut what about people who don't identify with a profession or a sex? What should I call them?\r\n\r\nAnd that got me thinking: isn't the world full of labels? We try so hard to eliminate the racial slurs and hurtful epithets, but what about the rest of our society's labels? \r\n\r\nWe're pigeonholed by our job, our social roles, and yes, even our names. Why should anyone have these brandings thrust upon them?\r\n\r\nAnd so I offer a modest proposal: that we completely do away with the practice of giving our children letter-based names, and instead bestow them with numbers.\r\n\r\nWhat better way to do away with the privileged advantages some people possess? Numbers are completely neutral, and would put everyone on an equal playing field!\r\n\r\nThat's right, everybody can have their very own, perfectly unique number. And since there are less than 7 billion people in the world, that means we'd only have to go to 10 digits for each individual. Most of us are perfectly capable of remembering ten-digit phone numbers, so why not ten-digit people numbers?\r\n\r\nIt's even better than our current system, because with numbers, no two people in the whole world need have the same name. So for instance, I might be 3,694,092,784. Or maybe 4,739,206,437. Who knows?!\r\n\r\nOf course, this would need to be phased in over a generation or two. But I'll be doing my part; my first-born son will be named 6,936,273,019. What do you think? Does it sound too ethnic?	t	t	2011-04-03 17:36:03-04	2010-11-23 11:21:24-05	2010-11-23 11:21:24-05	t
270	The Myth of Moderation	34	myth-moderation	582		I really dislike rallies. I've never participated in one—and I have no plans to start—but the idea turns me off. I'm always told of the value of social assembly in a democratic society, yet I'm challenged to find the meaningful results of peaceful demonstration (at least since 1980). But regardless of the method's efficacy, it's just not my scene.\r\n\r\nSo maybe I'm biased, but I really wasn't impressed by last weekend's "Rally to Restore Sanity." Jon Stewart announced the proposed rally on the September 16th episode of his Daily Show, in response to the August 28 "Restoring Honor rally" hosted by Glenn Beck.\r\n\r\nThe stated purpose of the rally was to give a voice to the politically disenfranchised centre, those without extreme political views. However, this goal requires further examination. I'm always sceptical of those who claim to be moderates, or above the political fray. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying Stewart himself is intentionally malicious, and I entirely agree that the American political discourse is controlled by loud-mouth entertainers, but Stewart fails to realize that he is part of that very problem. \r\n\r\nTo quote Dick Armey, "I was quite amused at watching the national comics stand up and decry with such sincerity that which they do every day on their shows. I thought it was so remarkable: 'I want you all in America to stop acting like we do on our show every night with our militant vilification of everyone with whom we have a disagreement.' "\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the title of "moderate" can occasionally act to disguise ulterior motives, be they merely partisan or actually dangerous. For example, Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), performed a rendition of "Peace Train" at the event.\r\n\r\nIt's quite fitting that they chose a man like Islam to perform, because he perfectly demonstrates the threat posed by the guise of political moderation. For all his songs about love and peace, he is a man who has demonstrated a devotion to hatred and violence. \r\n\r\nHere's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-wjxwpvqps/">video</a> of Islam on British television in 1989 voicing his support for the assassination fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie.\r\n\r\nThe best part is where he says he'd prefer to burn "the real thing" than merely an effigy of Rushdie.\r\nAnd here's a <a href="http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/3551/">collection</a> of related statements from Islam and Rushdie since that event.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is not to say that everyone at the rally was evil, mean-spirited, or dangerous. Only a very small portion of them were deranged, I'm sure. But that doesn't diminish the danger posed by the myth of moderation.\r\n\r\nAnd that's what it is: a myth.\r\n\r\nMost figures in history, from tyrants of antiquity to hot-air buffoons of modern times, have fancied themselves to be moderates. The political spectrum is a social construct, and as such, individuals have license to construct it as they please. \r\n\r\nSo saying you're a moderate is at best meaningless, and at worst illusory. There are many "moderates" who harbour views way outside the political mainstream, who've been able to hide behind their chosen label.\r\nIt's a disingenuous label, and it allows its adherents to claim immunity from criticism. This is a legitimate threat. \r\n\r\nWe all know to fear the guy yelling about tax slavery and holding a placard of President Obama with a Hitler-stache, but at least he's honest about his views. We also need to fear the guy who tells who he's a "moderate," sings you a song about peace, and then goes on to talk about lynching "blasphemous" authors and stoning adulterous women.\r\n\r\nWorse still are those who inflexibly cling to the label so to draw others into their field of gravity. \r\nThink about it, because you probably know somebody like this. I'm talking about the guy who rationalizes all his political views, regardless of where they fall on the spectrum, as "moderate." That's Jon Stewart.\r\nSo why does he cling so adamantly to the idea of political moderation?\r\n\r\nI have a theory I'm fleshing out: the political left would prefer a convivial system of cooperation and discussion, while the right would prefer an adversarial system of disagreement and forced compromise. The left like to call theirs the "moderate" approach, because it gives the appearance of civility. Given this assumption, we can see why most, if not all, of those calling for a "restoration of sanity" are tacit, if not vocal leftists.\r\n\r\nJon Stewart's disdain for adversarial politics is well documented. Take, for instance, this famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE/">clip</a> which led to the eventual cancellation of the CNN program "Crossfire:"\r\n\r\nHe tells the hosts their show is "hurting America." His complaints about the show's vapid and reductionist nature is entirely justified, but watch closely and you'll see that his concern is not merely with the nature of the game, but the game itself. That is, he doesn't like the idea of the left-right divide. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he's winning the battle. His ideal of a convivial, cooperative system appeals to many people disillusioned with the current state of affairs in the American political discourse. But they're merely trading one flawed system for another.\r\n\r\nIn all my affection for the adversarial system of government, I realize that it's not without faults, but it's still the best system ever devised, and I have no confidence in a non-adversarial system. And the adversarial system doesn't have to be dominated by the Glenn Becks or Keith Olbermanns of the world.\r\n\r\nCall me an idealist, but I believe in an adversarial system that works within a framework of civil discourse; a system that doesn't rely on taking to the streets, burning effigies, or painting vile caricatures to discern sound governance. It's a system to which any other would pale in comparison. \r\n\r\nJon Stewart's version of moderation only serves to remove all the substance from the political discourse. I don't mean to say that he doesn't have a role to play in that discourse, but we must realize Stewart's rhetoric about moderation is often as empty as that from those on the left or the right. This self-styled messiah of the American political system, isn't. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I have no problem with the "sanity" he's talking about: the thoughtful evaluation of conflicting ideas in a civil context, but trying to push everybody to the "centre" causes more harm than good. \r\n\r\nMaking everyone a moderate doesn't solve anything; it takes the essence out of the political milieu and reduces the debate to the lowest common denominator. I sympathize with the message of sanity (or Stewart's conception of it), but he loses all credibility to me by melding it with political moderation.\r\n\r\nI think we should take seriously Stewart's message about raising the discourse of politics, but we must jettison the empty rhetoric about moderation and moving beyond partisan politics, because the concept of political moderation is at best a misnomer and at worst a guise for ulterior motives. \r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm wrong about everything I just said. But if you think I am, you should tell me so. Don't be afraid to disagree, to tell me I'm wrong. In short, don't be a moderate. \r\n<i>How else will we ever know if I'm right or wrong?</i>	t	t	2011-04-03 17:37:14-04	2010-11-04 11:56:38-04	2010-11-04 11:56:38-04	t

I see black (orange pekoe grade) tea leaves and lilac coloured flowers (from the black currant). \r\n\r\nServing size: One tea spoon to one full mug water.\r\n\r\nRaw aroma: Sweet and earthy. Light smell of herb.\r\n\r\nBrewing aroma: Pure black tea.\r\n\r\nSteeping time: Seven minutes.\r\n\r\nTip: Many like to enjoy a black or green tea without the natural caffeine. To decaffeinate a pot, use multiple steeps. In the first, put in just enough water to bury the leaves, and let it steep for about a minute (nearly 80% of the caffeine in tea is released during this time). Toss the tea, and steep using the same leaves again. This will produce a much less caffeinated cup. The more this is done, the less caffeine remains in the brew. However, that also goes for flavour. To retain natural taste, only do this once or twice. \r\n\r\nThe now green-yellow brew has a great first sip. It’s light and tastes faintly of jam, with no bitter aftertaste (characteristic of black tea without honey or sugar). While the currant isn’t a strong note, it relieves my palate of any harsh black flavours. I taste the Earthy aroma of its brew a few sips in. Finishing the cup leaves me awake and alert, caffeine’s doing its job. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this as a quick, morning, out-the-door brew. While not entirely flavourful, the Black Currant tea doesn’t require any additives to neutralize bitter flavours. It also didn’t beg a long steep (I steeped my second cup for ten minutes and found no profound difference in taste). \r\n\r\n<b>Verdict</b>: 6.5/10	t	t	2011-04-03 17:39:14-04	2010-10-24 13:31:02-04	2010-10-24 13:31:02-04	t
241	Artist in Profile with Afterparty	27	artist-in-profile-with-afterparty	456		<!--image:"afterparty"-->\r\n<strong>1. Who are you?</strong>\r\n\r\nI am 1/6th of the Toronto based band "disco-punk" Afterparty, my name is\r\nKeith Heppler and I play the drums. The band has been around since 2006,\r\nwhen keyboardist Idan Erez met our lead singer Kristina B. at a party. The\r\ncurrent line up of the band has been in place for about a year.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. What do you do?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll we try to do is make the music we all want to hear and be the band we all would want to see. We all come from diverse musical backgrounds and we throw them all in a blender, turn it up and turn it on.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Where can someone find you?</strong>\r\n\r\nwww.myspace.com/afterpartyretro www.afterpartyband.com\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Where do you live and work and why?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe band is officially based out of Toronto Ontario, which is were we all wound up and found each other. But I don't think any of us were actually born in Toronto. Idan is from Israel, Juan is from Juarez Mexico, our new guitar player Josh is from Alberta, Ben is from Caledonia, Kristina grew up in Newmarket and I’m from Waterloo. As far as working most of us don't anymore, maybe an odd job here and there but the band takes up the majority of our time and energy.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. When did you start making music together?</strong>\r\n\r\nThat's a tricky one. Afterparty has been around in some form since about\r\n2006, when Idan and Kristina started writing songs together. I auditionedabout a year ago and Juan started playing guitar with us around then. So we did it as a foursome until about a month ago when we added Ben and Josh to help thicken up the sound live for all the shows we will be doing in support of our debut album "The Army You Got" in stores March 30,2010 on Sound of Pop Records.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. How would you describe your music? </strong>\r\n\r\nBlondie meets the Clash in rehab.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. What inspires you? </strong>\r\n\r\nI get inspired by anyone out there doing their own\r\nthing. I'm not impressed by people lost in trends, people who are so hip\r\nit hurts. It's pretty easy to separate the trendsetters from the\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. What's the nicest things someone has said you to after a show?</strong>\r\n\r\nKristina once told me I smelt good.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. What's the worst thing someone has said to you after a show?</strong>\r\n\r\n"I need you guys to settle your bar tab."\r\n\r\n<strong>10. What are your current obsessions?</strong>\r\n\r\nI can only speak for myself but I am really into the new Jay Malinowski\r\nrecord. I've also probably worn out all of my Nirvana records by playing\r\nthem so much.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. When someone says "Kingston" you think...</strong>\r\n\r\nI've been lucky enough to play in Kingston a few times with a few\r\ndifferent acts. The one thing that always sticks out in my mind is how\r\ncrazy your frosh week gets. I've never seen anything like it, it was\r\nawesome.\r\n\r\n<strong>12. What are you currently working on?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are constantly on tour in support of our new record "The Army You Got", which is available March 30th,2010 on Sound of Pop Records. Besides playing tons of shows, promoting the record we are starting to write some new songs as a six piece and trying to push our sound forward. Other than that we all love a good party!\r\n\r\n<strong>Afterparty play Clark Hall Pub tonight! </strong>	t	t	2011-04-03 17:05:01-04	2010-02-18 16:00:46-05	2010-02-18 16:00:46-05	t

But watching this movie on the most whined about manufactured holiday of the year has a special tinge of melancholy to it. \r\n\r\nI almost wish I could say that watching 500 Days of Summer was painful because it reminded me of the excessively emotional boys in my past (which is... also true...) but most of the pain is derived from breaking up with the culture worshipped in the movie. \r\n\r\nFrom the cringe worthy "Oh em gee, we both listen to the <strong>Smiths</strong>!!!111" elevator dialogue, to the male lead's adorable butchering of <strong>Pixies</strong>'  classic Here Comes Your Man, to the Feist and Spektor tracks slipping in as backtracks to post coital cuddle sessions, 500 Days of Summer reminds of my youthful 'innocence' and folly. Back when <strong>Garden State</strong> was my favourite move, back when <strong>The Shins</strong> and <strong>Belle & Sebastian </strong>were fresh, back when I only knew five people at my high school who watched <strong>The Wedge</strong> and they all bad skin and early curfews. \r\n\r\n Before I realized that everything in this niche is insufferably cliche, before I realized how commodified the aesthetic is, before anyone I knew had clued in to how the music and it's associated scene is often just a shrine to the excess and privilege in our lives, back when we thought we were so different and original.  before the Sarah Harmer line,<em> "we always thought that we were different, and we know now that we weren't"</em> felt personal. Before quoting song lyrics to describe your own internal landscape felt adolescent, because so were we.\r\n\r\nThis is a mopey self-indulgent lost love letter to a world that never was, but hey, isn't that what Valentine's Day is all about? \r\n\r\nI feel sorry for the friends with whom I'm watching with. First of all because I'm typing this throughout the whole thing (I needed some sort of outlet for the angst!) and secondly because I'm moaning in pain everytime a song I loved came on, making snarky comments anytime some archetypal <strong>Under the Radar</strong> or <strong>Filter</strong> magazine aesthetic was shown, and scoffing whenever Tom fulfills the post-<strong>Perks of Being a Wallflower</strong> flavour of misunderstood. \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure for them it's like watching a love story with someone who has been burned a few too many times. Instead of being betrayed by a person or, like Tom, ideas of true love, I, and I'm assuming some of you, have been betrayed by, the subculture, the aesthetic, the music, the movies, the books, the blogs... the.... scene?\r\n\r\nI broke up with the scene over two years ago now, before we even really got together.  When you're sitting in your bedroom reading blogs and webcomics to CDs you bought on a trip to Buffalo in a tshirt you got at a show on a trip to Toronto (fulfilling every lost lonely girl suburban cliche while you're at it!) you're not really in any scene per se other than the one on the internet and in your imagination. When you're finally away from the curfews and mall culture, the scene really isn't all it's cracked up to be.  It's full of vapidity, self-importance, cocaine and appropriation and exploitation, rich kids who pretend to be poor, exclusionary sneers and self-conscious smiles. \r\n\r\nOn Valentine's Days of the past I could easily excuse any singledom with a simple <strong>Hold Steady </strong>line about a girl who sang, "I'm saving myself for the scene."\r\n\r\nBut there's not really a scene worth saving yourself for. So hit the bottle, hit the club, and be open-minded when you're wandering around Metro at 2 a.m.  \r\n\r\nIf watching 500 Days of Summer has taught me anything, it's that <strong>Hornby's</strong> classic oft-quoted line, "It's no good pretending any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently, or if your favorite films wouldn't even speak to each other if they met at a party" is not very true at all.  Which, was, of course, the moral of <strong>High Fidelity</strong>, but most rock snobs conveniently forget that, choosing instead to live by the first hundred pages of the book. \r\n\r\nWell, the movie's over now, so I'm out. Until next year, and its inevitable nostalgia for another bad cultural relationship...	t	t	2011-04-03 17:06:46-04	2010-02-14 22:56:08-05	2010-02-14 22:56:08-05	t
269	To market to market: curried carrot and turnip soup	42	market-market-curried-carrot-and-turnip-soup	643		Recipe and photography by Elise Copps-Smith, ArtSci '11. <i>Contributor</i>\r\n\r\nThe Kingston Farmer’s Market is a great place to start if you’re looking for inspiration in the kitchen. Operating on Tuesdays and Saturdays in Kingston’s Market Square, and on Wednesdays outside of Stauffer Library, the market’s vendors offer fresh, seasonal produce. If you’re intent on buying local, ask sellers about where they buy or grow their products. The majority are cultivated nearby, which allows for the freshest and most environmentally friendly ingredients. \r\n\r\n<p>Kingston Market Square</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/market-square.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Market Square">\r\n\r\nIn honour of fall, I decided to opt for some earthy root vegetables. As the weather gets cooler, beets, turnip, carrots, parsnips, yams and potatoes continue to thrive. All of these make great hearty soups like the one below. Soups are the perfect fall meal, and can be prepared ahead of time, stored and reheated easily. For the novice chef, they are also very forgiving and can be tweaked to suit your preferences. \r\n\r\n<p>Market Options</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/market-options.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Market Options">\r\n\r\n<b>Ingredients:</b>\r\n6 large carrots                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n1 large or 2 small turnip                                                                                                                                                \r\n1 large onion                                                                                                                                                                  \r\n3 tbsp olive oil                                                                                                                                                                \r\n2 tbsp curry powder                                                                                                                                                      \r\n1 tsp cumin                                                                                                                                                                     \r\n2 litres chicken stock                                                                                                                                                     \r\n2 cups buttermilk                                                                                                                                                         \r\nSalt and pepper to taste                                     \r\nSour cream (optional)      \r\n\r\n<p>Raw Ingredients</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/raw-ingredients-curried-carrot-and-turnip.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Raw Ingredients">  \r\n                                                  \r\n<b>Tools:</b>\r\n1 very large sharp knife                                           \r\n1 large bowl                                                                                                                                                                                                   1 large oven safe baking dish                                                                                                                                        \r\n1 large pot                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n1 ladle                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n2 large spoons                                                                                                                                                                Blender \r\n \r\n<b>Directions:</b>\r\n\r\n1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Rinse carrots and roughly chop into 1 inch pieces. Since they will eventually be pureed, don’t worry about how they look. Just make sure that they are equally sized so they cook evenly. \r\n\r\n2. Depending on the size of your turnip, this may be a challenge. Cut in in half, and remove the tough stubs from either end. You will see a thin ring around the outside of the turnip just under the skin. Carefully cut off this layer and discard. Roughly chop the remaining turnip into 1 inch chunks. \r\n\r\n3. Place your carrot and turnip pieces into a large bowl and drizzle with 2 tbsp of olive oil. Sprinkle with curry powder and cumin, and a little salt. Depending on what you have around, these spices can be substituted, but I suggest sticking with eastern flavours. Toss until the vegetables are evenly coated with the spice mixture and pour into a baking dish. Place in the middle rack of the oven. Allow to roast for roughly 40 minutes, tossing occasionally. Don’t worry if the edges get a little dark, this will just add to the flavour of your soup. \r\n\r\n4. While your vegetables are roasting, pour 1 tbsp of olive oil into a large pot over medium high heat, and dice your onion into ½ inch pieces. Once the oil is heated, throw the onion into the pot, and stir intermittently until it has browned. Remove the pot from heat.\r\n\r\n<p>Roasted Vegetables</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/roasted-vegetables-curried-carrot-and-turnip-soup.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Roasted Vegetables">\r\n\r\n5. Once cooked, dump roasted vegetables into pot on top of your browned onion and place over medium low heat. Pour chicken stock over vegetables and stir. Vegetable stock can be substituted for a vegan/vegetarian version of this dish. Cover the pot with a lid and simmer for ½ an hour. \r\n\r\n6. This next part can get a little messy. Ladle the stock and vegetables into your blender. Only fill about 2/3 of the way and make sure that the stock almost covers the vegetables. Puree the mixture until smooth and pour it into a bowl. You will likely have to repeat this 3 or 4 times depending on the size of your blender. If you have one, a submersion blender can also be used. \r\n\r\n7. Once all of the soup is pureed, return it to the pot and add 2 cups of buttermilk. If you prefer it can be substituted for more stock, but I think that the sour flavour cuts the heat of the soup nicely. Give your soup a try and add more salt or spice to your taste. Ladle into bowls or Tupperware for storage and enjoy with a dollop of sour cream for a cool finish. \r\n\r\n<p>Finished Soup</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/finished-soup-carrot-and-turnip.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Finished Soup">	t	t	2012-05-15 09:14:44.633825-04	2010-10-25 19:14:08-04	2010-10-25 19:14:08-04	t
271	Just like home: bacon and chicken pot pie	42	bacon-and-chicken-pot-pie-recipe	718		Recipe and photography by Greg Kaladeen, ArtSci '12, <i>Contributor</i>\r\n\r\n\tFall is a perfect time to break out the pots and pans to cook something! Just touring the market floods you with inspiration; a colourful display of potatoes, apples, carrots and pears have me excited to heat up my kitchen. So do yourself a favour, toss out the Swanson dinner, and try something new and delicious!\r\n\r\nWith midterms over and most people having a bit of a lull before exams I thought I’d share a recipe that really tastes like home. It's something you won't have to stress over and could have fun making or sharing with a group of friends. \r\n\r\nThe thing to remember for this recipe is to taste throughout cooking; if it's good going in, it will be good coming out!\r\n\r\nServes 4-8 people, leftovers the next day are delicious.\r\n\r\n<b>Caloric Breakdown</b>\r\nBased on a six serving recipe, there will be roughly 420 Calories per serving. \r\nVersus a Pepperidge Farm "Original Flaky Crust Roasted Chicken Pot Pie" which comes in at 1,020 calories for a roughly similar portion. \r\nA single serving should be an adequate dinner for one person.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Ingredients</b>\r\n\r\nFilling:\r\n3 Medium sized red-skin potatoes, peeled and cut into bite sized pieces\r\n2 Chicken breasts, cooked (leftovers are fine, bone in if possible)\r\n2 Carrots, peeled and cut into bite sized pieces\r\n5-10 White pearl onions, rinsed\r\n3 Teaspoons of sugar\r\n\r\n<p>Cooked Vegetables</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/raw-veggies.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Cooked Veggies">\r\n\r\nCream Sauce:\r\n1 Litre of low-sodium chicken stock (one good quality box if you can afford it)\r\n1/2 Cup of hard apple cider\r\n1 Cup heavy cream\r\n3 Tablespoons of butter\r\n3 Tablespoons of all purpose flour\r\nA few slices of peameal bacon, sliced into bite sized pieces\r\nA teaspoon each of rosemary, thyme and sage \r\nBlack Pepper\r\n\r\nCrust:\r\n1 Package of puff pastry (best quality you can find)-keep in freezer until a few hours before you begin making it\r\n1 Egg\r\nFlour for rolling\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Directions</b>\r\n\r\nPrepare the Crust\r\n1. Take out Puff Pastry to thaw for 3 hours at room temperature before you plan on baking your pie.\r\n2. Once dough is soft enough to use, roll it out on a floured surface using an amount slightly larger than your pie dish and about 1/2 centimetres thick. \r\n\r\n  Prepare the Filling (If making with friends some could start on the cream sauce now)\r\n3. About one and a half hours before you plan on baking gather all the filling ingredients.\r\n4. Put the carrots, potatoes and onions in their own pot-individually, fill with water so that they are all fully submerged. Sprinkle a teaspoon of salt and sugar into each pot and bring them to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until just tender, about 8-10 minutes for the carrots and onions, and a bit longer for the potatoes. Once cooked to satisfaction, drain and place in the pie dish. Skin and slice onions in half before adding them in also. \r\n5. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and mix in with vegetables (keep the bones in for the next step)- at this point make sure to taste each of the filling components and season them if necessary. Preheat oven to 375°F.\r\n\r\n Prepare the Cream Sauce\r\n6. Pour the chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil on high heat; add rosemary, thyme and sage (chicken bones also if you have them).\r\n7. In a medium sized pan combine the butter and flour on medium heat for 2-3 minutes then remove from heat.\r\n8. Once the chicken stock has reduced by about half (20-30 minutes), strain it into the butter flour mixture, add the peameal bacon and cream. Simmer for 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour into pie dish.\r\n\r\n<p>Uncooked Pie</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/pre-oven-pie.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Uncooked Pie">\r\n\r\nFinish it Off\r\n9. Place pie shell onto your pie dish, make sure all the sides are well sealed by pinching and overlapping edges. Make a glaze with the egg yolk and a tablespoon of water; brush it over the entire shell of the pie. Use this as a kind of glue for the sides. \r\nPoke a hole in the centre of the pie (so that it doesn't explode) and place in the oven's bottom rack for roughly 25-40 minutes; or until crust is browned. Make sure to check on the pie regularly! Once the crust is flaky, the inside will be cooked. \r\n \r\n10. <b>Enjoy!</b>\r\n\r\n<p>Finished Pie</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/finished-pot-pie.JPG" width="450" height="350" alt="Finished Pie">\r\n\r\n<b>Ask Greg</b>: Have any suggestions or additions to this recipe?

260	New Blog on Campus 	32	new-blog-campus	643		The Queen's Journal is welcoming a new blog to the online hub, titled "Student Life".\r\n\r\nIn an effort to avoid cliché description of a student's life, I will not attempt to summarize such. On a diverse campus such as our's, the life of a student varies so wildly that little can be said to describe it. This blog will be a place for writers to post about their own student life, draw connections with those who read it and begin a forum of discussion about day-to-day activity from Bader to Brock and beyond. \r\n\r\nAs students transition from home to life away, or simply another year in tricolour, many encounter spirituality in an array of forms. The influences of religion- thought by some to be an abrasive force and to others the bedrock of life- are well and alive on campus. For those students hoping to find their spiritual niche, the Queen's Chaplain's office will be writing a blog about religious life in a non-denominational school. Kara Braun will post under the blog "Safe Space". Here students can find information regarding local religious events and openly access discussion about spirituality on campus. \r\n\r\nWhile the second year of Queen's Fauxcoming draws to a close, a buzz is echoed on campus. Over the steady hum of street cleaners on Aberdeen, there is the solemn sound of discussion- one which, before the end of this calendar year, will generate a decision about next year's Fauxcoming/Homecoming plans. Look to Student Life for updates on this discussion and opinions from campus groups about the potential re-instation of Homecoming next fall.\r\n\r\nFinally, Student Life will be releasing a series of posts about the ever-scrutinized on-campus governance, the Alma Mater Society. Arguably the largest and most active student group on campus has come to be one of the least understood. We hope to remedy this with break downs of who's-who and what's-what in AMS offices. Here we'll be formally opening discussion on the Mater- put your tams on and tell Student Life, are they playing your song?\r\n	t	t	2011-04-14 10:43:26-04	2010-09-22 13:53:30-04	2010-09-22 13:53:30-04	t

After my Anti-Valentines Day post I received a few concerned emails and phone calls. Thanks for reading friends, and yes, I’m fine. I’m leaving Kingston very soon and cannot stop feeling all sentimental and melancholy. I can’t gush enough about my friends. My ugly apartment seems quite lovely these past few days.

246	Things In Kingston I Will Miss When I’m Gone: Part One	27	things-about-kingston-i-will-miss-when-im-gone	456		<em>Coming to Kingston from a small town (and by “small town” I mean a population of about a thousand people—so yeah, actually small) was a huge step for me. Four years ago, I was too afraid to move to Montreal or Toronto so Kingston was it. For many Queen’s students, Kingston is a downsize—but I hate that word. \r\n\r\nAfter a few years working at The Journal and being involved in Kingston arts and culture scene I know I’m going to miss many of Kingston’s small—but totally mighty—landmarks. So I’ve decided to chronicle all of my favourite haunts, in a series of blog posts I’m going to call “Things In Kingston I Will Miss When I’m Gone.” It’s a long title, I know—but this might be an extensive list of places. I’m feeling nostalgic and who knows where that could lead.</em> \r\n<!--image:"mf"-->\r\n\r\nFirst on my list is Kingston’s artist-run center <a href="http://www.modernfuel.org/">Modern Fuel</a>. Today I was doing some very boring menial tasks downtown. It was rainy, cold and the wind was blowing—and then I realized I was only a block away from Modern Fuel, a free and always engaging art gallery. I’ve done <a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2008-10-21/arts-entertainment/hip-hoppin-and-anal-art/">anal art</a>, <a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2009-09-11/arts-entertainment/craigs-playlist/">danced</a>, <a href="http://img131.yfrog.com/i/modernfuel2.jpg/">drank</a> and been inspired at Modern Fuel. And today was no exception.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"mantra"-->\r\n\r\nCurrently in the main gallery is an exhibit by Élène Tremblay called Trail Proofs. Simple and quiet, Tremblay’s work is almost haunting. Against a backdrop of various concrete urban landscapes, Tremblay photographs and takes video footage of people in various poses—standing, sitting, laying down and standing. Sitting alone in the quaint gallery, I lost track of time. \r\n\r\n<!--image:"sit"-->\r\n\r\nIn the side gallery, two BFA students and friends Carlyn Bezic and Cecily Taylor have a show entitled The Number of Days. Using a variety of materials, scrap paper, collage materials and what might be considered trash Bezic and Taylor create something beautiful and collaborative. \r\n\r\n<!--image:"number"-->\r\n\r\nThanks for four lovely years of art and offbeat parties Modern Fuel. I’ll be back to visit. I’m a sucker for free things. \r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 17:04:40-04	2010-03-24 14:51:56-04	2010-03-24 14:51:56-04	t

236	Epitaph for My Heart	27	epitaph-for-my-heart	456		<!--image:"anti"-->\r\nThis is not a fact—I’m just guessing—but I think that there are probably more breaking-up songs in the universal songbook than getting-together songs. I’m almost positive there are more “fuck-you-asshole” than “I’m-sure-I’ll-love-you-forever” tunes. It’s just a hunch. Sadness has inspired some of the most beautiful art. Thank God for pain.

230	PS Pre-Pitchfork	27	ps-pre-pitchfork	456		<!--image:"ps"-->\r\n\r\nAs much as I love to make fun of Pitchfork, its readers and its sometimes convoluted reviews—I read it. Religiously. And you know what? They’re usually right. Those cool kids over at Pitchfork have also made (and broke) many musicians. Their influence has become massive since their inception in 1995.\r\n\r\nCanadian outfit Broken Social Scene has cited Pitchfork as being one of the reasons they started selling out venues. Merge executive Martin Hall told the Chicago Tribune that Arcade Fire’s debut record Funeral was out of print for a week after it received a 9.7 from the online magazine. These are just a few examples. Pitchfork has been responsible for the success of many obscure bands and they deserve credit.  \r\n\r\nAnd now, Kingston’s very own Paul Saulnier and Ben Nelson—more commonly known on the Internet as PS I Love You—have received an 8 out 10 (a pretty substantial number, considering the fact their critics sometimes give zeros) for their track “Facelove” on Pitchfork. You can read the review <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11709-facelove/">here</a>.\r\n\r\nBut, who would I be if I didn’t plug The Queen’s Journal in all of this?  Before his Pitchfork shout out, Paul got one in The Journal. I interviewed Paul at a bowling alley in Kingston and it has been one of my favourite interviews to date. You can find that piece <a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2008-09-09/arts-entertainment/ps-kingston-i-love-you/">here</a>. This year Ben and Paul also did a short, but hilarious<a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2009-10-13/arts-entertainment/kingston-love/"> Artist In Profile</a> for The Journal. It’s interesting to see how distinctly different the sentiments are in each of these pieces...Ever elusive, who knows what's next for Paul and Ben. \r\n\r\nMad props PS, you deserve it—and don’t forget us when you're famous.  \r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 17:05:27-04	2010-01-19 16:04:56-05	2010-01-19 16:04:56-05	t

Where do you live and work and why?</strong>\r\nI live in Brampton. I can't really call the band work. But if it were, then I work in a small van traveling around trying to make people smile. I travel with 3 other guys who also have the same mission. Why? Why not.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. When did you start making music together? </strong>\r\n10 years ago. Time flies.\r\n\r\n6. How would you describe your music?\r\nAggressive melodic pop, with a side of space.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. What inspires you?</strong>\r\nBeach boys, old jimmy eat world, failure, people who are extremely good at what they do and warm days.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. What's the nicest things someone has said you to after a show?</strong>\r\nI once told Walter from quicksand / rival schools how much his music meant to me and that it changed my life. He quickly replied, "you know what? One day someone is going to come up to you and say the same thing". I thought he was just being really nice. But one day someone did come up and say that to me. That's when I realized how truly powerful music can be.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. What's the worst thing someone has said to you after a show?</strong>\r\nThe other day a drunk girl told our tech that we were a great band, but sounded like shit.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. What are your current obsessions?</strong>\r\nLost.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. When someone says "Kingston" you think...</strong>\r\nUncle Doug.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\n12. What are you currently working on?</strong>\r\nI am so close to finishing my home studio. Built it from scratch with our bass player Erik. We gutted the basement and framed it all, wired it all, dry-walled it all ourselves. The only thing left is windows and doors. So close!

223	Local Talent	27	local-talent	579		<!--image:"crimes-in-paris"-->\r\n\r\nAfter local band Crimes in Paris rocked their mustaches and instruments for the Ale House Movember Party this past Saturday, I talked with their bassist Rudy Olsson about highlighting them on Limelight. Here's their lowdown: \r\n\r\n<strong>Band Members:\r\n</strong>Rayce Veitch: Vocals and Rhythm Guitar\r\nStuart Miller: Lead Guitar\r\nRudy Olsson: Bass\r\nZach Giannotti: Percussion\r\n\r\n<strong>What's the story behind your band's name?</strong>\r\n\r\nStolen from an Elvis Costello song (and tweaked to avoid any sort of conflict), Crimes in Paris sounded completely reasonable.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where and how did you originate?</strong>\r\n\r\nFrom Muskoka, Ontario, we came together in the eighth grade to play a talent show at our elementary school.  And after 10 years of playing talent shows, coffee houses, and totally devastating supernova sets in and around the Muskoka and Simcoe regions, we decided to relocate ourselves to Kingston.\r\n\r\n<strong>Are you all Queen's students?\r\n</strong>\r\nTwo of us have graduated from Queen’s with a Biology and LifeSci/Phe degree respectively.  Of the other two members, one is still attending Queen’s in music, and the other, just recently graduated from Guelph University with a business degree.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some of your main influences?\r\n</strong>\r\nOur influences range anywhere from punk, to folk, electro/house and 60’s brit-rock. The Beatles, Ben Folds, the Kooks, Sufjan Stevens, Radiohead, and Joe Jackson are pretty influential artists.\r\n\r\n<strong>How would you describe your sound?\r\n</strong>\r\nMelodically driven music, written acoustically and carefully molded into a full-band dynamic sound with the rare feeling of a well-written song.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you have any bands that you'd like to promote, other than your own?\r\n</strong>\r\nWinhara is a band located in Toronto; they’re friends of ours from Muskoka, as well as Queen’s Alumni.  <a href="null">www.myspace.com/winhara</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>If Crimes In Paris could have any present, collectively, for Christmas, what would it be?\r\n</strong>\r\n$30,000 to pay for our upcoming album costs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dream venue to play in?\r\n</strong>\r\nWembley Stadium in England, where many of our favourite artists have performed.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are your plans for a demo/record/performance schedule?\r\n</strong>\r\nWe have been recording at MetalWorks Studio in Mississauga since August, working on our debut album set for release in March 2010.  We have an upcoming show on Thursday, Dec. 3rd at Elixir nightclub, and our set starts at 10:30 PM.\r\n\r\n<strong>Can we expect you to pursue music post-grad?\r\n</strong>\r\nYes\r\n\r\n<em>Their Facebook</em>: <a href="http://">http://www.facebook.com/pages/CRIMES-IN-PARIS/118292194678?ref=search&sid=1657350051.1300878694..1</a>\r\n<em>Their MySpace</em>: <a href="http://">www.myspace.com/crimesinparis</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Next Show: Thursday, Dec. 3 at Elixir</strong>	t	t	2011-04-03 17:38:34-04	2009-12-01 16:17:21-05	2009-12-01 16:17:21-05	t

220	Introducing Ellie Goulding	27	introducing-ellie-goulding	2		<!--image:"ellie-goulding"-->\r\n\r\nWhat’s this, a blonde synth-pop minstrel songstress? How\r\ninnovative…how original, you scoff. But wait friends, this one’s got\r\nsomething special up her sleeve. Forget the fact her music has been\r\ndominating most music streaming blogs for the past few months, Wales\r\nnative Ellie Goulding has a one of a kind voice and a new take on a\r\ncrowded genre that’s sure to make ears happy from bedrooms to\r\ndancefloors.\r\n\r\nFirst things first, she’s not Lady Gaga, Lykki Li, Kate Nash, Little\r\nBoots, La Roux, Tracy Thorn, Imogen Heap or Bjork. Keep the\r\nmind-blowing tunes that hook you at first listen, save the theatrics,\r\ntorture device-esque costumes and public scandals and you may get a\r\nsense of where Goulding’s genre lies. She’s just a girl with her\r\nguitar—with a twist.\r\n     \r\nIt’s no secret I have the hots for Goulding’s harmonies. The first\r\ntime I came across her was by a lucky stroke of YouTube related video\r\nclicking fate. The folk meets dub synth “Wish I Stayed” melted me and\r\nI was devastated to discover only a few of her other tunes available\r\nfor listening on her myspace page. After a little investigation I\r\nlearned a handful of Gouldings tracks are produced by British\r\nelectro-pop commander Frankmusik and up-and-coming act Starsmith who\r\nsome may recognize as a source of a plethora of sick remixes floating\r\naround the web these days.\r\n\r\nLuckily, it’s true that good things come to those who wait because,\r\nalas, a few months have flown by and Ellie Goulding’s track list has\r\ngrown into something resembling the compilation of an upcoming album\r\n(or so I hope). Her songs range from the soul shattering “Fighter\r\nPlane”, to body reverberating sexy dance numbers like “Under the\r\nSheets”, to tracks like “Starry Eyed” that make you feel a little bit\r\nin love. If your term has been lacking in goosebumps, listening to\r\nthis might just be the next best thing.\r\n\r\nSearch Ellie Goulding at hypem.com to hear her tunes.\r\n<em>\r\n-Ally Hall</em>	t	t	2009-11-26 16:49:32-05	2009-11-26 16:43:09-05	2009-11-26 16:43:09-05	t
218	Artist in Profile with Jon Amor 	27	artist-in-profile-with-jon-amor	456		<strong>Who are you?</strong>\r\nI'm Jon Amor, an indie-folk singer-songwriter, Queen's student and native of Ottawa, ON.\r\n<strong>\r\nWhat do you do?</strong>\r\nI resolve existential angst by day, write and perform songs about it by night.\r\n<strong>\r\nWhere can someone find you?</strong>\r\nI’ll be playing Thursday night at Clark Hall Pub at 9pm. I play there quite often.\r\nAlso, Online at www.jonamor.ca and Monday night CoGro Open Mics have been a tradition of mine since first year\r\n\r\n<strong>Where do you live and work and why?</strong>\r\n I live and work NOP because the rent was cheaper and I’m generally a Skeleton Park fan.\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you start making music?</strong>\r\nI started writing songs with my gr. 9 band at Arts Canterbury High School in Ottawa , “The Walkoffs”, and we’d play around school and at performance assemblies and stuff. However, the first few dozen songs were so awful and cheesy, they will never be heard again. I place the official start of my songwriting career 2 years ago when I wrote “Side Porch.”\r\n<strong>\r\nHow would you describe your music?</strong>\r\nGenuine, reflective and mainly concerned with manifesting subjective internal experience as completely as I possibly can, while rhyming. Hints of classic Jewish neuroticism. Good for long bus trips at night, Sunday afternoons, and cold winter walks to class. I aim for warmth.\r\n<!--image:"jonamor"-->\r\n<strong>What inspires you?</strong>\r\nMusically, I’ve always been inspired by folk singer-songwriters like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Craig Cardiff, Jeff Tweedy from Wilco, Iron and Wine (Sam Beam), and Neil Young who put an emphasis on lyrical storytelling and deeply honest poetry. I’m otherwise inspired by most of what I take in, weather, my dog Maggie, late-night conversations with friends, stories and philosophy that I read, the quiet, introspective hours before dawn (the gloaming), etc.\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s the nicest thing someone has said to you after a show?</strong>\r\nIt wasn’t a real show, per se, but after busking in Ottawa’s Byward market a few summer’s back, I ended up hanging out with this Kerouac-type drifter who was traveling across the country because he had just lost his wife and wanted to commemorate their lives on the road together. After playing a few of my songs for him, the man started crying and told me that hearing my music at that point in time helped him bring a little comfort during his mourning. That was pretty affirming.\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s the worst thing someone has said to you after a show?</strong>\r\nI’m really not musically significant enough yet for people to want to criticize me to my face. Anything nasty has probably been when I was well out of earshot.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are your current obsessions?</strong>\r\nI’m been obsessively playing Dan Mangan’s new album “Nice, Nice, Very Nice”, Hey Rosetta’s “Into You Lungs” and Springsteen’s “Nebraska”. Otherwise, I just watched five seasons of Six Feet Under in about a month and a half. That’s a show that sticks with you - I can’t seem to write about anything other than death now.\r\n\r\n<strong>When someone says “Kingston” you think… </strong>\r\nThe last four years of my life, the people I’ve met, Clark Hall Pub, the Grad Club, spontaneous jam sessions down by Lake Ontario, Weeping Tile (Basement Apartment and Room with the Sir John A View), Apple Crisp, Busking on Princess Street…\r\n\r\n<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>\r\nI finally think I’ve got enough songs written that I’m proud of to get started on recording my debut record. I’ve managed to find a few musician friends to help out and it should be out sometime early in the New Year. \r\n\r\nJon Amor plays Clark Hall Pub this Thursday November 19th.  \r\n	t	t	2011-04-03 17:03:30-04	2009-11-19 19:46:20-05	2009-11-19 19:46:20-05	t

307	Sports - CIS Hockey Sunday	35	sports-cis-hockey-sunday	502	CIS, women's hockey, 2011 CIS championships, hockey	The 2011 CIS Women's Hockey Championships are over. The Gaels clinched the bronze medal in the dying minutes of the third period to win the final game of a season that has been called "miraculous" and a "Cinderella story."\r\n\r\nThe Queen's Journal has been proud to have witnessed many of these moments - from early season stumbles to a riveting OUA victory attended by many of you. We trudged through snow and ice to cover games at the Memorial Centre throughout the winter. We sat in sparsely populated stands and wondered about student turnout. We watched our bandwidth dwindle as the Gaels battled the Gryphons into a historic six-overtime victory in Guelph. \r\n\r\nAs with every Gaels team, we believed that our women's hockey team had it in them. And we felt that the student body deserved to see, read and hear about their dedication. That the student body deserved to be inspired. We traveled to Waterloo, Ontario with this in mind. \r\n\r\nThe following is my final compilation of images from the Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex:\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-2"-->\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-3"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-4"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-5"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-6"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-7"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-8"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-9"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"gaelswhockey3-10"-->\r\n\r\nKate, Lauri and I hope that our reports and images, late nights and hours in frigid press boxes and rinks and tolerance of an extremely repetitive playlist (Sweet Caroline, Final Countdown, Sandstorm, Teenage Wasteland etc) have been informative and relevant to our student audience. Queen's students deserve the coverage, and so do our Gaels. \r\n\r\nCongratulations, ladies. 	t	t	2011-08-09 12:50:09.005157-04	2011-03-14 20:21:30-04	2011-03-14 20:21:30-04	t
1	Kingston antiquity	38	kingston-antiquity	528	Springer Market Square, downtown, antiques, market	Springer Market Square offers a quintessential Kingston experience when it turns into an Antique Market. Better known for its Farmer’s Market, on Sundays the square showcases an eclectic array of treasures and trinkets. Hours of searching for furniture, books, paintings, jewellery, clothes and statues barely scratches the surface of this treasure trove.\r\n\r\nThe market dates back to 1801 and is stocked full of Kingston’s rich history. Items from early days at Queen’s and from the Canadian military are everywhere. It was in Springer Market Square that the Proclamation of Confederation was made on July 1, 1867, making it a fitting place for an antique market.\r\n\r\nVendors sell items from personal collections, flea markets, garage sales, estate sales and travels abroad. While the market allows vendors to display items they believe to be historically or culturally significant, some things are just randomly and inexplicably cool. For example, I was very close to buying a mini gargoyle. \r\n\r\nRuss Cassidy, owner of Rustique Antiques and frequent vendor at the market, said the age of an item doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more valuable.\r\n\r\n“Nostalgia drives the prices. You can tell someone’s age by what they look at,” he said.\r\n\r\nI was excited to find Disney-themed drinking glasses.\r\n\r\nAmong Cassidy’s items was a sextant. It’s a navigational instrument from World War II and was on sale for $325. Hunting for antiques feels like  being in a museum where you can hold the artifacts. Other vendors sold old war medallions.\r\n\r\nLooking to spruce up your digs before the new school year? The many lamps, paintings and prints put Urban Outfitters homewares to shame. Plus, you can’t beat the authenticity and amusement of a 1950s telephone that you can pretend once belonged to Lucille Ball.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing beautiful champagne glasses, martini mixer sets and crystal bottles, I imagined myself hosting glamorous cocktail parties for friends, while wearing gloves and fancy dresses. I then recalled that delicate glassware wouldn’t last long in my student house. Nor do I own a pair of gloves.  \r\n\r\nAfter examining various trinkets, I discovered that it’s a good idea to verify the price of a piece with its vendor. Though I didn’t see people haggling, it seems that some vendors are willing to sell items for cheaper than tagged.  \r\n\r\nThe Antique Market boasts an atmosphere of charismatic vendors sharing things they’re passionate about while engaged shoppers feed their nostalgia. Ask any vendor where an item originated and you’re sure to get a detailed and enthusiastic response. Even if you’re not in the market for a spinning wheel from the early 1900s, you’ll surely enjoy the novelty of the experience.\r\n\r\nThe Antique Market runs from April until the end of October on Sundays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nHere are some of my favourite items:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Books: $2 to $20</li>\r\n<li>Table:$750</li>\r\n<li>Phone: $20</li>\r\n<li>Maple syrup holder:$8</li>\r\n<li>Round tins: $6 to $10</li>\r\n<li>Clock :$125</li>\r\n<li>Suitcase:$45</li>\r\n<li>Trunk:$145</li>\r\n<li>Bookshelf:$25</li>\r\n<li>Dresser:$15</li>\r\n<li>Cookbooks:$2</li>\r\n<li>Martini shaker and glasses:$20</li>\r\n<li>Gargoyles and Buddha statues: $25 to $125</li>\r\n<li>Rings:$8, 3 for $20</li>\r\n<li>Wedding dress: $35</li>\r\n<li>Bracelets:$4 to $5</li>\r\n<li>Harmonica: $6</li>\r\n<li>WWII navigating instrument: $325</li>\r\n<li>Old magazines:$5</li>\r\n<li>Cameras from the 30s:$20 to $40</li>\r\n<li>Knife set: $18</li>\r\n<li>Disney glasses:$2</li>\r\n<li>War medals:$25</li>\r\n<li>Spinning wheel:$175</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<em>–With files from Kelly Loeper</em>	t	t	2011-08-14 15:42:27.780951-04	2011-08-14 16:25:41-04	2011-08-14 16:25:41-04	t
326	Keen on quinoa	41	keen-quinoa	528	Superfood, quinoa, grain	Quinoa is an ancient grain that has recently become a go-to food for healthy eaters everywhere.  Once referred to as “the mother of all grains” by the Incas, quinoa contains essential nutrients not found in other grains. Easy to prepare, quinoa has a light, fluffy texture and a slightly nutty flavour when cooked.\r\n\r\n<strong>Health benefits</strong> \r\n\r\n•\tNot only is it very high in protein, it’s considered a complete protein which means it includes all nine amino acids.\r\n\r\n•\tQuinoa contains lysine, an amino acid that’s essential to tissue growth and repair.\r\n\r\n•\tIt’s gluten-free for anyone who has gluten sensitivity.\r\n\r\n•\tA high source of magnesium, quinoa contributes to overall cardiovascular health.\r\n\r\n•\tIt contains riboflavin — a member of the vitamin B family that is said to help eliminate migraines.\r\n\r\n•\tIt’s an excellent source of dietary fibre.\r\n\r\n<strong>Nutritional data</strong>\r\n\r\nOne cup, cooked: 254 calories, 46.8 g carbohydrate, 4 g fat, 4 g dietary fiber and 9 g protein.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to cook quinoa</strong>\r\n\r\nFor one cup:\t\r\n\r\n1.\tSoak quinoa for about five minutes. Most packaged quinoa has been soaked and rinsed already but this extra step ensures that quinoa is cooked evenly.\r\n\r\n2.\tRinse well in strainer.\r\n\r\n3.\tPut into pot with one and a half cups of water. Add salt if desired. Bring to a boil.\r\n\r\n4.\tCover, turn stove to simmer. Cook for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n5.\tRemove from heat and let sit for five minutes. The cooked germ looks like a tiny curl.\r\n\r\n6.\tFluff with fork.\r\n\r\n7.\tAdd ingredients or enjoy as is!\r\n\r\n<strong>Meal ideas</strong>\r\n\r\nBreakfast\r\n\r\nCooked, quinoa can be eaten much like oatmeal, with honey, berries, and raisins. It can also be eaten raw with milk like corn flakes.\r\n\r\nLunch/Dinner\r\n\r\nModify your regular stir fry recipe by using quinoa instead of rice. Sauté with veggies, chicken, tofu and sauces to create a well-balanced meal.\r\n\r\nPrepare a quinoa salad. Mix feta cheese, green onions, chicken, cherry tomatoes and dress with olive oil and lemon. Both options are easily modifiable to accommodate your favorite foods and or fridge contents.	t	t	2011-09-15 23:56:56.929179-04	2011-09-16 00:56:53-04	2011-09-16 00:56:53-04	t

323	Trend Trial: OPI's Black Shatter	39	trend-trial-opis-black-shatter	680		Until you put on a coat of Black Shatter from Katy Perry’s OPI nail polish collection, there’s no indication of how the product is able to create its famed effect.\r\n\r\nAccording to the instructions, the first step is to put on a coat of a different nail polish .\r\n\r\nAfter it dries, top it off with a coat of Black Shatter .\r\n\r\nWhile it goes on like any other nail polish, black and smooth, it dries to create the shattered effect—and quite quickly .\r\n\r\nAlthough it does have quick results, the polish is not completely foolproof—first-time users should be aware that there seems to be an exact amount of polish to apply in order to achieve the shatter effect.\r\n\r\nThe first time I used it, I was warned a light hand would be best. Apparently I was too light, because the polish dried to black stripes. On my second hand, I used too much polish and my nails were too black to notice the shatter effect. Clearly this takes practice.\r\n\r\nI noticed that my nails tended to chip after only a few days, even when applying a top coat. This normally wouldn’t bother me so much, but after shelling out $13 for the polish and having to reapply it a few times to get it right, I expected a little more longevity.\r\n\r\nDespite some of its shortcomings, I like how many different looks can be created with Black Shatter. Each undercoat has a different effect. Some of the best ways I’ve seen Black Shatter used include pairing it with a metallic polish, a sparkly polish or a glossy black coat.\r\n\r\n	f	t	2012-05-21 17:40:49.584377-04	2011-09-12 12:47:42.08345-04	\N	f

324	Protein powder: necessity or gimmick?	41	protein-powder-necessity-or-gimmick	589		No matter how much we’re told that a proper diet and exercise are the ways to get fit, there’s always something out there to confuse us\r\n\r\nOn a recent trip home, I was baffled when I witnessed my mother religiously drinking protein shakes every morning, claiming it helps her build muscle.\r\n\r\nAll this time I thought protein powder was just another unnecessary health trend that people were tricked into thinking they needed.\r\n\r\nDo we need to add protein powder to our drinks each day to see results in our workouts? Or should we leave the powder to the guys on Jersey Shore?\r\n\r\nAccording to Peer Health Outreach Coordinator Beth Doxsee, protein accounts for a small percentage of our daily required macronutrients.\r\n\r\n“About 15 to 20 per cent of your diet should be protein,” she said, adding that 55 to 60 per cent should be carbohydrates and the rest should be fats.\r\n\r\nCommon sources of protein in an everyday diet are red meat, chicken, fish, tofu, almonds, eggs and lentils.\r\n\r\nAlthough protein powders are marketed mostly towards men who are weight training, many different groups of people use it because of how easy it is to mix into a drink.\r\n\r\nWhile protein does play an essential role in cell growth, repair and maintenance, Doxsee said, many people overestimate how much they need. Movie stars, for example, who train for several hours a day to build muscle for a role consume more than the average amount of protein.\r\n\r\n“Their caloric intake has increased significantly. Most people in North America have enough protein in their diet, if not too much.”\r\n\r\nAlthough protein is important for muscle repair when heavy weight training, it’s not the only thing that people should focus on consuming.\r\n\r\n“If someone is doing heavy weight training it’s really important to make sure you have a mini meal after,” she said. “Something that includes protein, carbohydrates and fats.” For this reason, Doxsee said she prefers more natural sources of protein.\r\n\r\n“You should know the ingredients of foods you’re consuming.” Doxsee said she would recommend something as simple as having a piece of bread with peanut butter and banana for a good after-workout meal because it includes all three macronutrients and is less artificial.\r\n\r\nIn other words, stick to regular food and you’ll do just fine.	t	t	2011-09-19 15:25:18.253622-04	2011-09-19 15:25:18.24836-04	2011-09-19 15:25:18.24836-04	t

330	The price of local produce	42	price-local-produce	528	Farmer's market, local produce	Every Wednesday the farmer’s market sets up shop between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. in front of Stauffer Library, giving students unique access to locally grown produce. During the summer season, the market sets up every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The <em><Journal></em> set out to break down the prices and origins of some in-season products found at the farmer’s market and compare them to options at Metro.\r\n<h4>\r\nFarmer's market</h4>\r\n\r\n- Blueberries: $3/pint, from Picton, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"blueberries1"-->\r\n\r\n- Cherries: $4/pint, from Niagara, Ont.\r\n\r\n- Raspberries: $5/500g, from Napanee, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"raspberries"-->\r\n\r\n- Lettuce: $3.50/head, from Battersea, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"lettuce"-->\r\n\r\n- Tomatoes: $3/lb, from Napanee, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"tomatoes"-->\r\n\r\n- Potatoes: $3.50/lb,  from Napanee, Ont.\r\n\r\n- Garlic cloves: $2.75/clove, from Odessa, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"garlic"-->\r\n\r\n- Onions: $0.75/onion, from Napanee, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"onions"-->\r\n\r\n- Loaf of whole-wheat bread: $4.75, from Wolfe Island, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"bread"-->\r\n\r\n- Nikita's raspberry jam (with vanilla): $6.95, from Kingston, Ont.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"jam"-->\r\n\r\n<h4>Metro</h4>\r\n\r\n- Blueberries: $4.99/pint, from USA\r\n\r\n- Cherries: $3.31/lb, from USA\r\n\r\n- Raspberries: $2.99/100g, from USA\r\n\r\n- Lettuce: $1.49/head, from Ont.\r\n\r\n- Tomatoes: $3.99/lb, from Mexico\r\n\r\n- Potatoes: $3.99/2lbs, from USA\r\n\r\n- Garlic cloves: $0.99/5 cloves, from Ont.\r\n\r\n- Onions: $1.49/lb, from Canada\r\n\r\n- Loaf of whole-wheat bread (Dempster's): $3.39, from Ont.\r\n\r\n- Raspberry jam (Kraft): $5.49, from Ont.\r\n\r\nEach shopping experience had its advantages. Overall, Metro’s prices were cheaper. However, they import products from other countries instead of offering locally grown options. Having personally taste-tested the food above I can say the farmer’s market produce proved fresher and more flavourful. There is also the added bonus of talking to vendors who personally grew or baked the products themselves. Plus, foods less travelled have significantly less of a carbon footprint.  \r\n\r\nWeigh these factors next time you’re grocery shopping:\r\n\r\nShopping at the farmer’s market:\r\n\r\n•\tVery fresh produce\r\n\r\n•\tInteractive, community-oriented shopping experience\r\n\r\n•\tSupports local farmers\r\n\r\n•\tHigh quality and flavour\r\n\r\n•\tOrganic\r\n\r\n•\tCreative, personalized options (e.g. raspberry vanilla jam, vegan bread from Wolfe Island)\r\n\r\nShopping at Metro:\r\n\r\n•\tCheaper prices\r\n\r\n•\tVery convenient location and hours\r\n\r\n•\tCan purchase out of season, imported produce (including bananas, pineapple)\r\n\r\n•\tOne-stop shopping for the rest of the items on your grocery list	t	t	2011-10-03 23:43:33.412068-04	2011-10-03 23:43:33.406841-04	2011-10-03 23:43:33.406841-04	t

The Kingston-born rocker returned to stage with his full band in tow. \r\n\r\nDecked out in black and playing to a crowd of young and old, the band kicked-off their night with  their ’91 classic “House Arrest” from the album <em>Waking Up the Neighbours</em>. Fans not only jammed to their live tunes but took their love of the Canadian icon onto Twitter, using the hashtag #AdamsinKingston. \r\n\r\nTo show his hometown some love, he changed the lyrics of “Thought I’d Died and Gone to Heaven” to “Thought I’d Died and Gone to Kingston”. As the night continued, a lucky Queen’s engineering student sporting a leopard t-shirt was hand-picked by Adams to join him on stage for “When You’re Gone”. \r\n\r\nThe <em>Journal’s</em> Arts Editor Savoula Stylianou and Assistant Photo Editor Tiffany Lam were on-site for an Adams-experience. \r\n\r\n<!--image:"adams"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"crowd"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"screengood"-->	t	t	2012-05-04 11:08:37.336939-04	2012-05-04 11:02:58-04	2012-05-04 11:02:58-04	t
336	Conscious of the cure: breast cancer awareness	32	breast-cancer-awareness	589		By Beth Doxsee\r\nPeer Health Outreach Coordinator\r\n\r\nAlong with fall weather and midterms, October brought breast cancer into the forefront of peoples’ minds thanks to pink ribbon campaigns and events like Run for the Cure.  To give you an idea of the scope of this disease, in 2010 over 23,300 women and 180 men in Canada were diagnosed with breast cancer.  That means that approximately one in 9 women will be affected by it.  Although the survival rate has increased significantly from 1980, there is still no known cause or cure. Over 5,300 women and 50 men died as a result of their diagnosis in 2010.\r\n\r\nBecause the majority of breast cancer diagnoses occur in women aged 50-70 years, most people in their twenties think that it’s something they need not worry about until much later in life.  But what you do now can have a big impact on your breast health later in life. While there is no known cause of breast cancer, there are definitely things that put you at an increased risk.  Even though you’re unable to change some risk factors (i.e., your gender, age and genetics), there are a lot of risk factors that you can change.\r\n\r\nSo, here are some of the modifiable risk factors:\r\n\r\n•\tBody weight - Try to stay in the normal weight category for you height.\r\n\r\n•\tPhysical activity – Aim to get 30 minutes of physical activity every day.\r\n\r\n•\tDiet – Go for lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains and avoid eating too many foods high in sugar and fat.\r\n\r\n•\tAlcohol use – Have one drink or less a day. Increased alcohol use correlates to increased risk, regardless of whether you’re drinking spirits, beer or wine.\r\n\r\n•\tTobacco smoke – Avoid both first- and second-hand smoke especially during your adolescence when your breasts are developing.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you can start doing in your 20s is get to know your breasts on an intimate level.  Here’s how you become breast aware through four simple steps:\r\n\r\n1. Know how each of your breasts normally look (i.e., size, shape, colour)\r\n\r\n2.  Know what changes to look for:\r\n\r\n•\tUnusual, or persistent pain in your breast(s) or armpit\r\n\r\n•\tSwelling under your armpit or collarbone\r\n\r\n•\tNipple changes – shape, position, discharge or being pulled inward\r\n\r\n•\tRedness, rash or other skin irritation\r\n\r\n•\tLumps, thickening, dimples or puckering \r\n\r\n3.  Feel each whole breast, above and below plus under each arm.  \r\nNOTE: there is no right or wrong way to do this.  You can move your middle fingers in small circles around those areas or any other way that feels comfortable to you.\r\n\r\n4. Report any changes to your health care provider.\r\n\r\nEven though breast cancer tends to be a disease that affects older women, it can still be diagnosed in younger women.  For example, in 2008 actress Christina Applegate was diagnosed at the age of 36 and underwent a double mastectomy.  On Oct. 19, 37 year-old E! News correspondent Guiliana Rancic underwent a double lumpectomy to treat the early stages of breast cancer.\r\n\r\nSo, take control of the risk factors you can change and become breast aware!

332	Mindful meditation	32	mindful-meditation	785	meditation relax stress health	Mediation offers the chance to de-stress and relax, focusing energy internally.\r\n\r\n “We see the world as fragmented,” meditation leader Rory Skelly said. “Meditation is a quiet place where you try to allow all that to settle a bit.” According to Skelly, our brains are hardwired to multi-task and focus on multiple things happening externally. Meditation allows us to become aware of what’s within ourselves.\r\n\r\nParticipants are encouraged to accept both emotional and physical feelings as they arise and acknowledge them without judgment.\r\n\r\nI practiced Mindfulness Meditation where the primary goal is to achieve awareness of oneself and one's physical and mental presence.\r\n\r\nAfter the 45-minute silent session, I felt lighter and had a noticeably calmer attitude. Two fellow participants in the session said they felt the same results.\r\n\r\nSkelly often refers to Pema Choron, a Buddhist nun from Gampo Abbey in Nova Scotia who said, "Sitting meditation gives us a way to move closer to our thoughts and emotions and to get in touch with our bodies."\r\n\r\nAfter one experience I can understand this philosophy; it's now something that I hope to incorporate into my regular routine.\r\n\r\nAlthough I enjoyed meditation, sitting for 40 minutes without talking or moving may not be the right experience for everyone. Although Skelly and his students both suggest starting with a group class, because meditating with other people is motivating, it’s not necessary. You don’t need a meditation leader or a yoga studio to take a deep breath and re-evaluate your mind and body.\r\n\r\n Skelly offered three important tips to try when practicing meditation at home:\r\n\r\n<strong>Attention</strong>\r\n\r\nTo meditate, it’s recommended to pay attention to one function of your body, such as the movement of your breath, an emotional thought, or a physical ailment.\r\n\r\n<strong>Curiosity</strong>\r\n\r\nSkelly said mindful meditation allows you to be curious about where your thoughts lead. If your thoughts stray, acknowledge the new thought without elaborating on it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Gentleness</strong>\r\n\r\nTo refocus your attention, do so gently. You should never criticize yourself; calmly bring your attention back to what you had decided to focus on in that session.\r\n<em>\r\nSkelly leads a silent meditation class every Tuesday at 5 p.m. at Feel Good Yoga Studio on Princess Street. It's free of charge and is open to everyone.</em>\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-05-15 09:21:23.441756-04	2011-10-03 23:48:58-04	2011-10-03 23:48:58-04	t

338	No bones about it	41	no-bones-about-it	528		Most calcium ads are targeted at women over the age of 40. That’s why it’s a surprise to most people that peak bone mass is actually reached between the ages of 25 and 30. It means our university years are crucial for bone development, says Peer Health Outreach co-ordinator Beth Doxsee.\r\n\r\n“You can do a lot now to help yourself later in life,” Doxsee said, adding that a decline in bone mass usually starts after the age of 50.\r\n\r\nCalcium isn’t only necessary for the bone health, but for proper muscle function, nerve conduction, enzyme activity and the formation of cell membrane.\r\n\r\nHowever, a high-calcium diet isn’t always conducive with student living.\r\n\r\n“With students, dairy products can get warm and spoil more easily,” Doxsee said.\r\n\r\nHigh-calcium foods you wouldn’t expect:\r\n\r\n•\tAlmonds and almond products\r\n\r\n•\tFortified soy milk and soy products\r\n\r\n•\tKale (as well as other dark greens) •\tBroccoli\r\n\r\n•\tSardines\r\n\r\nMany products also have calcium rich options, such as Asana yogurt or Tropicana orange juice with calcium. Fortified soy products and cereals are also available.\r\n\r\n“People often associate calcium products with higher fat content, yet it doesn’t have to be the case. Some of these foods are great examples,” Doxsee said.\r\n\r\nIncreasing calcium intake can help prevent osteoporosis and breaking bones.\r\n\r\n“Weight-bearing exercises also help build up bone density and strength,” said Kathryn Humphries, health promotion co-ordinator at Queen’s Health, Counselling and Disability Services.  Factors such as family history and gender also play a role in the loss of bone density. Women lose bone mass at a greater rate than men, thus should pay particular attention to calcium consumption.  One should get about 2-3 servings of calcium throughout the day, totalling about 1,000 mg of calcium.\r\n\r\nFor example, one glass of milk contains 300 mg and one cup of almonds contains 250mg.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-11-03 14:13:05.691082-04	2011-11-03 14:13:05.685679-04	2011-11-03 14:13:05.685679-04	t

Add tomatoes and tomato paste then cover with a lid and leave for 15 mins at least! Feel free to leave it for longer on a low heat, but if you are in a rush, 15 mins will help all the ingredients mix well.\r\n\r\n-Add the remaining olive oil, the black olives parsley. Cover and leave for a further 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n-Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately over rice, couscous, or pasta.

Peel and slice the crab and avocado into thin strips to prepare.\r\n\r\nWhile the rice is still warm, transfer it into a large bowl and mix in the vinegar. Make sure to taste test so the rice isn’t overpowered by the vinegar. The rice is typically sweet but has a sharp, sour aftertaste.\r\n\r\nLine both sides of the bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap and lay one sheet of dried seaweed, shiny side down. Line it with three heaping tablespoons of flattened sticky rice. The key here is to only line the sheet 3/4 full, leaving a gap on one edge of the seaweed sheet. It allows for the roll to tuck in properly.\r\n\r\nOn the rice, place two thin slices of crab and avocado and add pressure so the ingredients stick together.\r\n\r\nLine the seaweed sheet up with the edge of the bamboo mat, fold it over and roll.\r\n\r\nI was lucky to have Tomoya Tago, president of the Japanese Relations at Queen’s Club, instruct me in the art of sushi-making.\r\n\r\nWhile the first few attempts were ugly, sushi rolling became easier after a little practice. I quickly learned that adding sticky rice to the final fold would help keep the ingredients in place.\r\n\r\nCut the rolls into bite-sized pieces and serve with soya sauce and wasabi.\r\n\r\n— Terra-Ann Arnone	t	t	2011-11-04 11:42:32.033394-04	2011-11-04 07:00:00-04	2011-11-04 07:00:00-04	t
342	Swedish invasion	39	swedish-invasion	528		Queen’s fashionistas rejoice as Swedish super-chain H&M comes to Kingston.  After taking over the space of six stores and a restaurant, H&M opened on Oct. 20 at Cataraqui Town Centre to 400 people already waiting in line.  H&M spokesperson Emily Scarlett said the decision to open a store in Kingston came after countless customer requests over email, Facebook and their website. “We really like to listen to our customers,” She said.\r\n\r\nShe said 2000 people were expected to have travelled through the store by the end of its opening day. By 1 p.m., determined shoppers waited in lines curving through the entire store.  The store has sections for women, men and children.\r\n\r\nCovering 8000 sq. ft. and two floors, the store was still spacious and easy to navigate despite the amount of patrons.  Like its other locations, it has a mix of trendy and traditional, formal and fun, laidback and luxurious.\r\n\r\nScarlett said the store was selling a lot of multipurpose items like as chunky knits, which she described as “ideal for the Canadian customer.”\r\n\r\n“They can be layered, accessorized, worn with jeans, leggings,” she said.\r\n\r\nFaux fur was another popular item, featured on everything from jackets, scarves and bags.\r\n\r\nOther trends we noticed are sure to be seen on campus soon: elbow patches, tweed, and lots of leather.\r\n\r\nMany Queen’s students are excited for the addition to the Kingston fashion scene.\r\n\r\n“It fits the student budget, it’s trendy and there’s more of a variety,” said Athena Nicholas, ArtSci ’12.  “Everyone shops at the same stores. This just adds more diversity.” Although there was a shuttle going from Queen's campus to the store on its opening day, Nicholas said the usual longer bus ride shouldn’t be a problem.\r\n\r\n“People will definitely be willing to take the bus. It’s worth the trip.”\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm1"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm2"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm3"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm8"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm9"-->\r\n\r\nFall/winter trends we spotted:\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm4"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm5"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm6"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm7"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hm10"-->\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-12-07 14:03:27.67627-05	2011-12-07 14:03:21-05	2011-12-07 14:03:21-05	t
340	Exploring the healthy side of Leonard cafeteria	41	exploring-healthy-side-leonard-cafeteria	528		Many first-year students learn the hard way that the “Freshman Fifteen” isn’t just a myth. With a meal plan that presents unlimited junk food options, it’s no surprise the healthy eating habits of home fall by the wayside.\r\n\r\nPublic Health Dietician Heather McMillan accompanied me to Leonard Cafeteria to assess what was on the menu.\r\n\r\n“Always take a look all around the caf and see what you really want to eat instead of sampling,” McMillan said.\r\n\r\nNot only does this prevent overconsumption, but it also avoids food waste. This is a good way to avoid loading your tray with dishes you will either eat or waste before you have seen all that is available.\r\n\r\nStudents should aim to cover three out of the four food groups with each meal and use the Canada Food Guide to balance their plates, McMillan said.\r\n\r\n Half a plate should be portioned for vegetables and fruit, one quarter for grains and one quarter for meat and alternatives. Round out the meal with a glass of milk.\r\n\r\n“The salad bar looked really good,” McMillan said. “If the salad is your meal, add one of the lean proteins.” At Leonard, tofu, kidney beans and chick peas are offered at the salad bar. Opt for the vinaigrette-based dressings as the creamy ones usually contain more fat.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"leonard1"-->\r\n\r\nMcMillan also recommended the grain salads, like the Mediterranean couscous salad. They contain vegetables and are a convenient way to cover two food groups.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"leonard4"-->\r\n\r\n“Burgers are not something you want to be eating every day,” McMillan said at the grill section. If you are going to eat there, always ask for a whole wheat bun and add veggies from the salad bar to your burger.\r\n\r\n“Veggie burgers can also be a lower fat alternative,” McMillan said.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing a hot meal option, go for the meal with the most vegetables. I chose a vegetarian chilli that had lean proteins and a couple of servings of vegetables in the meal alone.\r\n\r\nMcMillan also recommended stir fries as a healthy and convenient option. They cover three food groups and include vegetables and lean proteins.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"leonard2"-->\r\n\r\n“Sandwiches are also great. There were whole wheat breads and pitas available,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I would suggest choosing one of the leaner meats, such as the turkey or tuna instead of the salami. Add vegetables to the sandwich, or round your meal out with a salad or a piece of fruit.”\r\n\r\nDuring my first year, I definitely ended up eating a slice of pizza as an appetizer to most meals.  “Pizza is not something you want to be eating every day,” McMillan said. “However, you can make it a better choice by selecting whole wheat crust and healthier toppings.” For desserts, keep the portion sizes small. McMillan recommended the milk-based pudding as a good option.\r\n\r\n “Don't try and swear off everything as ultimately you'll probably go for it anyways.”\r\n\r\nThough fruit juices often count as a serving of fruit, only take a small cup and dilute with water. The milks are always a good choice, said McMillan, adding that drinking pop only contributes sugar to your diet.\r\n\r\nMcMillan also noted that as a stop on the way out of the cafeteria, the fruit bar offers a healthy snack option for the end of a meal or for later on in the day.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"leonard3"-->\r\n\r\n “You want to make sure you’re having a well-balanced meal if you’re going to be in class for a few hours,” McMillan said.\r\n\r\nTips to keep in mind while eating in Queen’s cafeterias:\r\n\r\n•\tWhole wheat: Always select the whole wheat option. More fibre will keep you full longer and will help your digestive system stay moving.\r\n\r\n•\tPortion control: It’s better to take a smaller portion first. If you’re still hungry afterwards, you can always grab more.\r\n\r\n•\tFruits and vegetables: Always find ways to add them to your meals. Chances are you’re not getting enough.\r\n\r\n•\tVariety: This goes especially for meats and alternatives. Choose lean proteins when possible. Examples include skinless chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, beans and chick peas.\r\n\r\n<em>Anyone can call EatRight Ontario at 1-877-510-5102 with any questions about nutrition.</em>\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-11-03 16:43:04.411597-04	2011-11-03 16:43:04.40563-04	2011-11-03 16:43:04.40563-04	t
341	Vintage Kingston	39	vintage-kingston	528		Princess Street is lined with charming, unique boutiques boasting fabulous merchandise. But many students target the same stores and it’s not unusual to see multiple ladies on campus wearing your latest purchase. One way to avoid it is to go vintage.\r\n\r\nDowntown Kingston boasts two stores dedicated to vintage clothing. Though there are other thrift stores, such as Phase 2, that sell used clothing, these places seek out vintage pieces. \r\n\r\n“Shopping vintage, you get something unique. It’s not like shopping at Urban Outfitters where everyone will have the same thing,” said Jo-Anne Brulé, manager of Starling Vintage Lovelies at 316 Princess St.\r\n\r\nStarling buys most of its merchandise in Toronto.\r\n\r\n“People like to shop vintage because it’s a fun way to shop, a fun business to work in,” Brulé said. “There’s a great ambiance in the stores.”\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage1"-->\r\n\r\nStarling has a cozy, intimate atmosphere. Sequins, lace, prints, furs, velvet and silks are in abundance.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage2"-->\r\n\r\nBrulé identifies a purple, 50’s style velvet and silk cocktail dress with cuffs as her favourite item.\r\n\r\nShe features floor-length dresses, jackets, coats, blouses, shoes, purses, clutches, lingerie, knits and scarves, to name a few. I have had much luck in the past with their hats and costume jewellery.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage3"-->\r\n\r\nGuys looking to try something vintage will find ties, suspenders, cuff links and plaid shirts.\r\n\r\nShoes go from $15 to$45, dresses from $20 to$60, costume jewellery is $5 each and boots from $25 to$50.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage7"-->\r\n\r\nWhat’ll I Wear, located a few stores down is downtown Kingston’s other vintage trove.\r\n\r\nOwner Janet Strong searches for her merchandise in estate sales and thrift shops in the small towns outside of Kingston.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage8"-->\r\n\r\nStrong has been in the vintage business for 30 years and attributes the appeal of these clothes to their quality.\r\n\r\n“Clothing was better made a long time ago. Everything was very tailored and structured. I look for natural fibres and wool,” Strong said.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage4"-->\r\n\r\nMy favourite item was a fur evening stole hanging next to an equally exciting sequined bolero. The coat selection is incredible.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage5"-->\r\n\r\nPrices range from $1 items in their loonie bin to $100 for more one-of-a-kind pieces.\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks leading up to Halloween, the store has been packed.\r\n\r\n“You can barely move in the store,” Stong said.  It’s not hard to imagine why. Aside from the potential costumes (Kimonos, leather jackets, tartans), Strong has wigs, coloured hair sprays, masks, tiaras, dramatic hats, boas and feathers. “It’s great for the creative Halloweener.”\r\n\r\nWhat’ll I Wear is celebrating 16 years at its current location.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"vintage6"-->\r\n\r\nPicker’s World Market at 1473 Princess Street also has vintage clothes along with their antiques. Alley Cat Antiques at 207B Wellington Street is worth checking out as well.\r\n\r\nVintage shopping is fun even if you’re not quite ready to buy an antique . It’s a great way to browse for clothes without thinking about trends or whether or not someone else has it. But a little patience is required. There’s a lot to go through and sometimes sizes are small.  However, chances are you’ll walk out surprised at what you found.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-11-04 00:59:08.997947-04	2011-11-04 00:59:08.965704-04	2011-11-04 00:59:08.965704-04	t
339	Trend trial: feather hair extensions	39	trend-trial-feather-hair-extensions	589		Each season, new trends seem to spread like a virus — the sea of Canada Goose Jackets, crop tops and gladiator sandals across. This summer, everyone seemed to be trying out feather hair extensions. Most people I talk to either love or hate the trend with a passion.\r\n\r\nSome thought the look was edgy and different, while others thought it was silly to spend money and time to put feathers in their hair.\r\n\r\nStill undecided myself and curious about the hype, I tried a Do-it-Yourself approach. This seemed popular among other price-conscious followers of the trend.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be such a variety of feathers to choose from, from fluorescent pink and peacock green to more neutral browns. I finally decided on some skinny black and white Rooster saddle feathers from online store Etsy; I figured they would be natural enough to blend in with my brown hair. According to the website, Rooster saddle feathers could be washed, heat-styled and last up to at least a few months.\r\n\r\n<strong>Materials:</strong>\r\n\r\n•\tRooster saddle feathers (Etsy online store, $12 for five)\r\n\r\n•\tCrimp beads (Michael’s, $4)\r\n\r\n•\tWire (Michael’s, $4)\r\n\r\n•\tPliers \r\n\r\n<!--image:"feathers1"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The process:</strong>\r\n\r\n•\tSection off a piece of hair that the feather will attach to.\r\n\r\n•\tWrap the wire around the piece of hair and thread through the crimp bead.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"feathers2"-->\r\n\r\n•\tTake the end of the feather and thread it through the crimp bead.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"feathers3"-->\r\n\r\n•\tWith the pliers, clamp the crimp bead shut\r\n\r\n<!--image:"feathers4"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The verdict:</strong>\r\n\r\nThe DIY version was much cheaper than getting it done at a salon (I found the process priced at around $40.00).\r\n\r\nThe materials weren’t hard to find, although having to order feathers online took about 10 days. The feathers themselves were good quality and were able to be washed, blow-dried, straightened and curled. I also didn’t feel ridiculous wearing them because they blended fairly well into my hair when I wanted them to (I don’t quite think I could pull off bright pink). I was also proud at my ability to save money and successfully put the extensions in myself. It’s worth trying out.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-11-04 11:39:01.939607-04	2011-11-04 11:39:01.939591-04	2011-11-04 11:39:01.939591-04	t
345	How to work out at your desk	41	how-work-out-your-desk	528		Studying and schoolwork can no longer be an excuse for avoiding exercise. There are ways to incorporate bouts of exercise while working at a desk.\r\n\r\nLifestyle and Wellness Consultant Julianne Ryder said that today’s sedentary society sees people sitting stagnantly for hours on end, including students.\r\n\r\n“Students spend so much of their day sitting, whether in a lecture, at their computers, in the library or on a bus,” Ryder said. “They can get caught up in their work, but in order to do well in our studies we need to be at our peak health.”\r\n\r\nWe asked Ryder to share some of her fitness tips from her program “‘Exec’ucise.” It’s designed to keep executives active while working in an office but Ryder modified the exercises with students in mind. All of these exercises can be done in less than 10 minutes periodically throughout the day. I’d say most are discreet enough for Stauffer Library.\r\n\r\n<strong>General tips</strong>\r\n\r\nMove around: Break up the stagnant sitting and ensure continuous blood flow by getting up and walking around the room on a study break.  “Go up and down the stairs a couple of times, use the washroom on another floor,” Ryder said.\r\n\r\nSit on an exercise ball: Sub your office chair at home with an exercise ball.\r\n\r\n“Sitting on it will strengthen your core. You can also roll it away from your desk and use it for crunches.”\r\n\r\nFull body stretch: Complete whenever possible to avoid aches and cramps.\r\n\r\nTime management: Scheduling study breaks that incorporate activity can help with effective time management. Arrange to meet up with a friend and throw a ball around or walk around the block. Activity breaks help with concentration.\r\n\r\nRyder said activity does more than just maintain fitness levels.\r\n\r\n“Exercise contributes to de-stressing. It’s equally as important to book in activity time to keep stress in check.” \r\n\r\n<strong>Chair squats</strong>\r\n\r\nSlide your bottom out to the very edge of the chair and perch for a moment. Press up through the heels of the feet and come to a standing position. The goal is to repeat the standing/sitting motion without allowing your bottom to sit on the chair. This exercise works all of the muscles in the legs. Inhale as you squat down and exhale as you press up through your heels.\r\n\r\n<strong>Static lunges</strong>\r\n\r\nIn this version, you’re just dropping your knee down rather than stepping forward or back. Feel free to hold wall or chair for balance if needed. One foot forward and one foot back, by about three feet. Bend back knee towards floor and make sure to keep front knee behind the toes. Keep torso straight and abs in as you push through the front heel. Do as many reps as desired and switch legs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Desk push ups</strong>\r\n\r\nYou can strengthen your chest and triceps without having to get down on the floor to complete this exercise. Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the edge of your desk. Bend the elbows and allow your chest to move towards the desk. Only move to the point where you have a 90 degree angle at the elbows, then push up and return to the starting position. Breathe out as you push your body away from the desk and inhale as you allow your body to return towards the desk.\r\n\r\n<h4>Stretches</h4>\r\n\r\n<strong>Shoulders</strong>\r\n\r\nClasp hands behind back (don’t link fingers) and open up chest. This is an important stretch because you’re leaning forward while sitting at a desk.\r\n\r\n<strong>Back</strong>\r\n\r\nLink hands in front of your chest as though you’re hugging a barrel and open up shoulder blades.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-12-07 14:31:02.076593-05	2011-12-07 14:24:23-05	2011-12-07 14:24:23-05	t

346	Prioritizing ourselves as well as our academics	32	prioritizing-ourselves-well-our-academics	528		It’s the most wonderful time of the year ...  after we get through one of the worst.\r\n\r\nExam period can be an endless cycle of stress and anxiety that sees many of us prioritize academics over everything else. It might seem more productive to spend an extra hour at the library to cram rather than sleeping for an extra hour sleep or hitting the gym. But letting health and well-being fall to the wayside can actually prove detrimental to our academic performance during this hectic time of year.\r\n\r\nNot only do we increase our chances of becoming sick, we decrease our level of alertness and mental productivity when we ignore sleep, nutrition and exercise. There is also that unwelcome experience of entering the holiday season feeling like a zombie.\r\n\r\nWe asked Lifestyle Consultant and Personal Trainer Pam Fountas to share why it’s important to be mindful of our health decisions during exam period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sleep</strong>\r\n\r\nFountas said we are actually decreasing our productivity when we try to get through exam period on little sleep.\r\n\r\n“Mental productivity and level of alertness are not nearly where they could be if we were getting enough sleep. We have to read and re-read paragraphs and chapters because our level of retention goes way down, affecting your academic performance.”\r\n\r\nStudents may be able to pull off functioning on little sleep for a night or two, but it won’t last the whole period. Also, coffee doesn’t replace the necessity for sleep.\r\n\r\nBy making sure they’re getting enough sleep so that they feel rested, students will optimize their time and performance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Nutrition</strong>\r\n\r\nConvenience and long sessions at the library see people grabbing unhealthy snacks on the go that don’t exactly complement a balanced diet.\r\n\r\nA big thing to be careful of, whether or not you’re making poor choices, is the amount of food you consume. It can spike your blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\n“When you’re not eating a balanced diet, you will experience highs then lows in your energy levels,” said Fountas.\r\n\r\n“By not making healthy choices, your energy and alertness will be negatively affected.”\r\n\r\nFor snacks, Fountas recommended pairing a clean carbohydrate with a protein.\r\n\r\nExamples: Veggies and hummus, fruit with natural nuts, banana with peanut butter, whole grains. The pairing helps to balance energy levels because the protein takes longer to digest, keeping you full and nourished longer.\r\n\r\nRealistically, many of these options are available at food places on campus, so consider the benefits of grabbing the healthy snack next time you’re at the vending machine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Exercise</strong>\r\n\r\nFountas said students who don’t believe they have enough time to exercise during exams need to be honest with themselves about how they are budgeting their time. Students might be procrastinating in ways that they don’t even realize.\r\n\r\n“You are actually buying yourself more time by making smart choices about your health. It can be as little as a 20-minute run, but you will actually feel that much better and put more time into your studies.”\r\n\r\nFountas also said students should stay away from all-or-nothing thinking. Just because you may not be able to fulfill your regular exercise routine, doesn’t mean you need to abandon it completely.\r\n\r\n“There are 24 hours in the day and it is up to us to choose how we want to spend them. Taking 30 minutes out of the day for yourself will serve you so much better in the long run.”\r\n\r\n<strong>How to cope with stress</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the moment: “One of the simplest things you can do is to bring awareness to your breath. Practice the technique of mindful breathing. Just take a few deep breaths in a moment of anxiety and you should feel yourself relax,” Fountas said.\r\n\r\nBig picture: Fountas said students should be clear on what they’re expecting of themselves from their academics.\r\n\r\n“Make an action, feel prepared and keep some perspective,” Fountas said. To help keep stress in check, “try and take 10 to 15 minutes out of each day to tap into the outside world. It can be exercise, a phone call home, or a walk downtown to remind yourself that there is a world bigger than exam period.”\r\n\r\nSo by making wise health choices this exam period, we will maximize our potential for academic success. There is also the chance that we can emerge feeling like the healthy human beings we were before exams started.  	t	t	2012-05-15 09:20:43.245326-04	2011-12-07 14:31:17-05	2011-12-07 14:31:17-05	t
347	Low-fat vs. classic: carrot cake	42	low-fat-vs-classic-carrot-cake	589		By Carolyn Flanagan and Kelly Loeper\r\nJournal Staff\r\n\r\nWhether you’re looking for something sweet to get you and your housemates through exams or to bring home to your family for the holidays, carrot cake is an easy and delicious dessert for the season.\r\n\r\nAs there are so many different recipes out there, we decided to try two variations: one with more traditional ingredients and another with healthier substitutions.\r\n\r\n<h4>Classic version</h4> \r\n\r\n<strong>Ingredients</strong> \r\n\r\n•\t4 eggs\r\n\r\n•\t1 1/4 cups vegetable oil\r\n\r\n•\t2 cups white sugar\r\n\r\n•\t2 teaspoons vanilla extract\r\n\r\n•\t2 cups all-purpose flour\r\n\r\n•\t2 teaspoons baking soda\r\n\r\n•\t2 teaspoons baking powder\r\n\r\n•\t1/2 teaspoon salt\r\n\r\n•\t2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\r\n\r\n•\t3 cups grated carrots\r\n\r\n•\t1 cup chopped pecans\r\n\r\nFor the cream cheese frosting:\r\n\r\n•\t1/2 cup butter, softened\r\n\r\n•\t8 ounces cream cheese, softened\r\n\r\n•\t4 cups confectioners' sugar\r\n\r\n•\t1 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n\r\n<strong>Directions</strong> \r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 350 F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9" x 13" inch pan.\r\n\r\nIn a large bowl, beat together eggs, oil, white sugar and two teaspoons of vanilla. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stir in carrots. Fold in pecans. Pour into prepared pan.\r\n\r\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.\r\n\r\nTo make frosting: In a medium bowl, combine butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and one teaspoon vanilla. Beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Stir in chopped pecans. Frost the cooled cake.\r\n\r\n<em>Source: allrecipes.com</em>\r\n\r\n<h4>Low-fat version</h4>\r\n\r\n<strong>Ingredients</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--image:"carrotcake1"-->\r\n\r\n•\t3/4 cup all-purpose flour\r\n\r\n•\t3/4 cup whole wheat flour\r\n\r\n•\t1 cup granulated sugar\r\n\r\n•\t1/4 cup flaked sweetened coconut\r\n\r\n•\t2 tsp baking soda\r\n\r\n•\t1 tsp salt\r\n\r\n•\t2 tsp ground cinnamon\r\n\r\n•\t2 tbsp canola oil\r\n\r\n•\t2 large eggs\r\n\r\n•\t1 1/2 tsp vanilla\r\n\r\n•\t2 cups grated carrots, peeled\r\n\r\n•\t20 oz. can crushed pineapple in juice, drained \r\n\r\n•\t1/4 cup chopped walnuts plus 1/4 cup for topping\r\n\r\nFor the cream cheese frosting:\r\n\r\n•\t1 cup powdered sugar\r\n\r\n•\t1 tsp vanilla extract\r\n\r\n•\t1 cup low fat Philadelphia Cream Cheese\r\n\r\n<strong>Directions</strong>  \r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 350 F (175 C). In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, coconut, baking soda, salt and spices. Stir well with a whisk.\r\n\r\nIn a medium bowl, combine oil, eggs and vanilla. Stir well. Add grated carrots and pineapple. Fold wet ingredients with the dry ingredients. Batter will be stiff and dry but keep folding it and it will all come together. Fold in 1/4 cup chopped nuts.\r\n\r\nSpoon batter into an 8" x 3" cake pan coated with cooking spray. Bake at 350 F (175 C) for about 40 to 50 minutes, depending on pan size or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and cake is pulling away from sides of pan. Cool cake completely on a wire rack.\r\n\r\nTo prepare frosting, beat together cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla until smooth. Spread frosting over top of cake. Garnish with remaining chopped walnuts.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"carrotcake2"-->\r\n\r\n<em>Source: skinnytaste.com</em>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste test</strong> \r\n\r\n<!--image:"carrotcake3"-->\r\n\r\nAfter tasting both versions, our fellow Journal staffers could all distinguish between which version was more traditional and which contained lower fat ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe traditional version tasted richer and the frosting was sweeter. The low-fat version tasted lighter, most likely due to the substitution of pineapple juice for oil. Although different, both versions were successful.\r\n\r\nPlaying around with substitutions is a great way to cater recipes to different tastes and preferences; experimenting in the kitchen also makes for a great study break!\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-12-11 22:09:10.065319-05	2011-12-11 22:08:58-05	2011-12-11 22:08:58-05	t
348	Food culture on campus part 1: Three Sisters Feast	42	food-culture-campus-part-1-three-sisters-feast	528		Every Wednesday night from 5 to 7 p.m., Four Directions Aboriginal Student Centre hosts a free drop-in meal for students.\r\n\r\n“It’s for all students, staff, faculty and community members as well,” said Laura Maracle, Aboriginal Advisor at the centre.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"threesistersfeast"-->\r\n\r\nThe feast serves a home-cooked meal prepared by staff or a guest chef in a setting meant to make students feel relaxed and welcome. It is named for the tale of the Three Sisters: the bean, the squash and the corn. In the tale and in nature, the bean leans against the corn and together they shade the squash, all supporting and ensuring each other’s growth and survival.\r\n\r\n“We all come together, we communicate, we hang out,” she said.\r\n\r\nBefore the meal is served, the Centre honours a few Aboriginal traditions.\r\n\r\n“First we prepare the meal. We acknowledge our ancestors and give thanks for everything we have today by leaving them a plate first,” Maracle said.\r\n\r\n“Then we smudge the whole house,” she said.\r\n\r\nSmudging is a sacred ceremony meant to cleanse the space through the smoke of the four sacred medicines: cedar, sweet grass, sage and tobacco.\r\n\r\n“We strive to make it as inclusive as we can. In our culture, family is very important and that extends to the community as well,” said Aboriginal Advisor Vanessa McCourt.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"threesistersfeast2"-->\r\n\r\n “There are already so many academic spaces on campus,” McCourt said. The Four Directions Aboriginal Centre offers a more casual environment that sees community members of all ages coming together.\r\n\r\nOur visit during the holiday season feeds us turkey, stuffing, roasted vegetables, salad and apple pie. The menu varies weekly and meals include spaghetti, pumpkin soup, stews, salads and desserts, to name a few. They oftentimes serve traditional items such as banic, a bread that is a staple in Aboriginal cuisine . There are always vegetarian and lactose-free options available as well.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"threesistersfeast3"-->\r\n\r\nStudents enjoy the feast because it’s a unique opportunity on campus.\r\n\r\n“The Three Sisters feast is a way for me to experience different meals with different people. The food is delicious, the people are very kind, and I even got a chance to eat in a real teepee once,” Mike Cornacchia, ArtSci ’12, said.\r\n\r\nNext time you’re in line at the ARC on a Wednesday night, consider stopping by Four Directions Aboriginal Student Centre to experience a new campus food culture.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2011-12-13 14:10:39.192413-05	2011-12-13 14:01:59-05	2011-12-13 14:01:59-05	t

355	A new Princess Street favourite: Spin Dessert Café	42	new-princess-street-favourite-spin-dessert-cafe	589	dessert, reviews, downtown, restaurants	By Megan Cui\r\nContributor\r\n\r\nAlready a veteran of the dessert-café game, Spin Dessert found a new home on 260 Princess St. for the delicious fare and urban chic aesthetics of its original Toronto venue. A little different from its neighbor’s traditional design scheme, Spin’s most attractive feature is its open concept design. The first level is split up by demi-stairs into levels. The elevated section in the back has a smattering of Parisian café tables that’s a nice alternative to the plushier, banquette seating arrangement at the front of the store. Take another look and you’ll notice there’s an entire basement level that’s visible from above through a transparent balcony. Exposed pipes cap off an atmosphere of cozy sophistication.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"spindessert1"-->\r\n\r\nI set my mind to eating the biggest, baddest thing on the menu and thought my larger-than-life appetite could handle it. It also doesn’t hurt, certainly, that the workings of the bakery and espresso bar are on full exhibition and the selection of in-house cakes behind their shiny glass displays speak for themselves.  We ordered “Baby It’s Cold Outside,” which is one of many tempting options amongst the January Red Velvet promotion. It’s a red velvet cake smothered in red velvet ice cream, white chocolate shavings and whipped cream. I was worried the cake would drown in the ruby sea of liquid velvet but it held its own—super moist and unbelievably rich in cream cheese flavor.  Next up was the interesting “On the Floor:” pistachio ice cream on waffles might be intimidating to some, but it was something I needed to try.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"spindessert2"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"spindessert3"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"spindessert5"-->\r\n\r\nIt was unconventionally savory and I commend Spin Dessert for venturing outside of the box. Pistachio ice cream is great for having a salty bite that can pull ice cream’s usual sweetness into a new direction.  Unfortunately, Spin Dessert’s rendition fell a little short and offered an ice cream that didn’t taste too different from a traditional vanilla-based ice cream. It was a little nuttier and still creamy with generous chunks of pistachio nuts.\r\n\r\nTo wash it all down, I ordered a chai latte but ended up clutching to my iced water for the most part to cope with so much ice cream.\r\n\r\nI have mixed emotions about Spin Dessert. The ingredients are amazing so all the waffles, ice creams and crepes taste flawless, yet there’s something left to be desired in terms of originality and diversity of flavors to keep me coming back.  It would be more exciting to see less traditional desserts to match Spin’s modern aesthetic.\r\n\r\nSpin though does offer a savory crepe selection and an all day breakfast menu which I have yet to try.\r\n\r\nThe portions are a bit excessive so I recommend going to Spin Dessert with lots of company, a big appetite and a sweet tooth. For a moderate dessert lover like myself, it was a great day for new experiences, but I’ll definitely prepare my stomach before my second visit.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-02-14 00:20:39.0231-05	2012-02-14 00:20:36-05	2012-02-14 00:20:36-05	t
358	Faculties offer alternative jackets 	39	faculties-offer-alternative-jackets	589	Arts and science, student life	By Carolyn Flanagan\r\nAssistant Blogs Editor\r\n\r\n<!--image:"veganjackets"-->\r\n\r\nOne of Queen’s most iconic symbols is getting a little sibling.\r\n\r\nThe Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (ASUS) is offering an alternative faculty jacket to students who either do not want to pay the high price of the traditional leather, or who want a more animal-friendly option.\r\n\r\nASUS is now offering a windbreaker modelled after an American Apparel design.\r\n\r\nKathleen Liu, services commissioner of ASUS, said the new style isn’t meant to replace the original.\r\n\r\n“We kept the crest and colour, and students can till sew on the bars. The only difference is the material.”\r\n\r\nAvailable for $100, the jacket is significantly cheaper than the $300 original. It also appeals to a new demographic.\r\n\r\n“The windbreaker is a great alternative for spring. Besides, not everyone feels that they can pull of the leather jacket,” Liu said.\r\n\r\nThe custom-made jacket is currently available for ArtSci and CompSci students only.  The first 50 jackets, offered at a promotion rate of $80, sold out in one hour at the campus bookstore.   Jackets Director Alex Nicholson said there was demand for a vegan style since ASUS doesn’t sell “pleather” jackets. “We were asked a lot if there was a non-leather option for the jackets, so the response has been really positive.”\r\n\r\nNicholson said they hope to make the windbreakers available to other faculties as well in the near future.\r\n\r\nJackets will be available for order at the campus bookstore until tomorrow.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-02-14 00:20:59.828363-05	2012-02-14 00:20:57-05	2012-02-14 00:20:57-05	t
359	Trend trial: tuxedo nails	39	trend-trial-tuxedo-nails	589	nails. trends, celebrities	By Katie Heffernan\r\nContributor\r\n\r\n\tWhat better way to celebrate a black tie affair than to arrive with tuxedo nails? It’s a trend seen on celebreties like <em>New Girl</em> star Zooey Deschanel at this year’s Golden Globes. These nails are fun, creative and versatile and can make a great conversation starter at your next party.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"tuxedonails"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"tuxedonails2"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The trial</strong>\r\n\r\n1)\tBegin by painting a thin base coat to strengthen nails and provide a solid foundation for the polish to stay.\r\n\r\n2)\tSelect a white nail polish. I recommend any French White found in a French manicure kit. Apply the polish and make sure to do two to three coats to achieve solid coverage.\r\n\r\n3)\tAfter letting the white colour dry, apply a clear top coat. This is important to seal in the polish for the next step.\r\n\r\n4)\tBefore painting the black strip on the tip of the nail, apply a small strip of scotch tape across the nail, leaving the tip exposed.\r\n\r\n5)\tSelect a black polish and paint only the exposed tip. The tape will help to create a barrier between the white and will also leave a clean line.\r\n\r\n6)\tAfter allowing the black tip to dry, the artistic portion begins. Carefully peel away the tape and begin the design. The easiest way to achieve the tuxedo look is to use a black nail art pen, available at any drug store. Simply make the two dots and draw a bow as you would using a pen on paper (you can also use a toothpick and simply dip it in the black polish to create your own paint tool).\r\n\r\n7)\tIt’s important to let the design dry completely before trying to add anything or apply another top coat. A different nail art pen or the dip of a toothpick in the white polish allows you to embellish the bows and add your own personal flair to the design.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"tuxedonails3"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The verdict</strong>\r\n\r\nThe style looks professional, chic and fun at the same time. I would suggest getting a friend to help with the design on your opposite hand as the detail was difficult to accomplish alone. With so many different layers, the top coat was the most significant for making sure the polish from a previous step wouldn’t peel off.  Although applying many coats of one colour can be tedious, the end result is worth the wait.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-02-14 00:21:06.789107-05	2012-02-14 00:21:03-05	2012-02-14 00:21:03-05	t
356	Valentine’s Day cupcakes: a new spin on a classic treat	42	valentines-day-cupcakes-new-spin-classic-treat	589	valentine's day, dessert, recipes	By Kelly Loeper\r\nBlogs Editor\r\n\r\nEvery Valentine’s Day, dessert recipes seem to be more creative than the year before. As a typical student baker, I’m always on the hunt for something that’s easy, fast and cheap to make. This recipe includes an interesting twist that’s sure to impress everyone on Valentine’s Day—whether it’s a significant other, housemate, for a single-but-not-lonely girls party or if you just want to procrasti-bake.  \r\n\r\n<strong>Ingredients</strong>\r\n\r\n•\t1 package white cake mix\r\n\r\n•\t1 1/4 cups water\r\n\r\n•\t1/3 cup vegetable oil\r\n\r\n•\t3 egg whites\r\n\r\n•\t8 drops red food coloring\r\n\r\n•\t2 drops raspberry candy oil\r\n\r\n<strong>Directions</strong>\r\n\r\n1.\tPreheat an oven to 175 C (350 F). Line a standard muffin tin with paper cupcake liners.\r\n\r\n2.\tBeat the cake mix, water, vegetable oil and egg whites together on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium for two minutes until smooth. Fill cupcake liners 1/3 full with white batter; set aside.\r\n\r\n3.\tStir four drops of red food coloring into the remaining bowl of batter to make the batter pink. Stir in the raspberry oil. Pour 1/3 of pink batter into a resealable plastic bag and set aside.\r\n\r\n4.\tMix more food coloring into the remaining bowl of pink batter until it’s an orange,red color and pour the batter into a resealable plastic bag. Cut a corner off the bag, stick the open tip into the center of each cup of white batter and squeeze in about two tablespoons of red batter.\r\n\r\n5.\tCut the corner off the bag with the pink batter, stick the open tip into the center of the red batter and squeeze about one tablespoon of pink batter into each cup.\r\n\r\n6.\tBake the layered cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. It takes 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely before frosting.\r\n\r\n <!--image:"cupcakes1"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Verdict</strong>\r\n\r\nThe recipe was super easy to make. Although the lighter pink shade of the batter didn’t show up well when baked, the different colours on the inside of the cupcake has a cool effect.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"cupcakes2"-->\r\n\r\nI ended up having lots of leftover dark pink batter, so I used it to make mini cupcakes.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I used a premade cake mix and icing went unknown to everyone who tried them; they were too impressed and surprised by the cherry flavour and colours in the centre. All in all, the recipe was a success. As the recipe suggested, this could also be fun to do for different occasions: green and mint flavour for St. Patrick’s Day or orange for Halloween.\r\n\r\n<em>—Source: allrecipes.com</em>\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-02-14 00:20:46.108745-05	2012-02-14 00:20:42-05	2012-02-14 00:20:42-05	t

354	Food culture on campus part two: Queen’s Hillel Shabbat dinner	42	food-culture-campus-part-two-queens-hillel-shabbat	589	food, culture, hillel	By Carolyn Flanagan\r\nAssistant Blogs Editor\r\n\r\nFour times a semester, Queen’s Hillel hosts a traditional Shabbat Dinner at the Hillel House, located at 124 Centre St.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hillel1"-->\r\n\r\nAlex Lulka, Shabbat and Kashrut chair, begins preparing for the meal two days in advance.\r\n\r\n“All food is kosher, and the kitchen remains kosher at all times,” she said.\r\n\r\nAbiding by rules of the Jewish Shabbat, everything is prepared before sunset on Friday evening.\r\n\r\nAt 7 p.m., between 60 and 120 students gather at the Hillel House to eat. Attendees included mostly Hillel members but non-members and guests as well.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hillel2"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hillel3"-->\r\n\r\nAfter a short blessing is said on the wine and challah, egg bread braided into a loaf, food is served.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hillel4"-->\r\n\r\nThis past Friday’s menu included meatballs, chicken, potatoes, chicken soup, cooked vegetables, pasta and quinoa salads. Traditional items included potato and noodle kugel, a casserole-type dish. Everything was delicious. A personal highlight was the noodle kugel, thanks to its use of cinnamon and raisin.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hillel5"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hillel6"-->\r\n\r\n<!--image:"hillel7"-->\r\n\r\nThere’s food in abundance and second and third helpings are whole-heartedly encouraged. At the end of the night, aluminum foil is brought out for those who want leftovers.\r\n\r\nHillel Vice-President Naomi Rosenfeld said attending the Shabbat dinner can feel like a home away from home for students.\r\n\r\n“Many people grew up sharing these traditions with their families; this is a chance to carry them on,” she said.\r\n\r\nHillel Co-President Ashlee Woolfson said it also draws students who have never participated in a Shabbat dinner before. “It is really for all students at Queen’s who want to come,” she said. “Everyone is welcome.” She added that Hillel House aims to be pluralistic among the denominations of Judaism as well.\r\n\r\nDinner is free with Hillel membership which costs $35 per year, $20 per semester or $10 per meal.  The next Shabbat dinner is scheduled for March 16.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-02-15 10:55:25.911871-05	2012-02-14 00:20:08-05	2012-02-14 00:20:08-05	t
360	Eating disorders at university	32	eating-disorders-university	589	eating disorders, health, wellness	By Carolyn Flanagan\r\nAssistant Blogs Editor\r\n\r\nFebruary was National Eating Disorder Awareness Month.\r\n\r\nA highly complex mental health disorder, Mental Health First Aid Canada defines eating disorders as “severe disturbances in eating habits (either eating too much or too little), or weight control behaviour.”\r\n\r\nPrevalent among university students, the most common eating disorders for the age demographic are anorexia, bulimia and binge-eating.\r\n\r\nPeer Health Outreach Co-ordinator Beth Doxsee said eating disorders have many triggers. “There can be a family link—be it genetic or because of a role model,” she said. “There are social and cultural factors as well. We are constantly bombarded with messages and images about an ideal body type that may not be attainable.”\r\n\r\nDoxsee said there’s often an underlying mental health disorder, such as anxiety or depression.\r\n\r\n“The food restriction or consumption becomes a way to deal with other things going on. There is a need to feel control,” she said.\r\n\r\nA university-wide survey conducted in 2008 by Student Affairs showed that 5 per cent of students had been diagnosed with an eating disorder. Almost 50 per cent of students surveyed said they were trying to lose weight, even though 60 per cent had a healthy Body Mass Index standing.\r\n\r\nStill a taboo subject in many circumstances, misconceptions persist about the disorder.\r\n\r\nEating disorders are often considered as only an issue in women, but rates of anorexia and bulimia are climbing in men.\r\n\r\n“There is also the misconception that it won’t go away,” Doxsee said. “You can get better.”  “If you’re in the middle of it, it’s hard to see the signs,” said Doxsee. “Reaching out to anyone, friends or family is an important step. Then get professional help as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all way of dealing with eating disorders. Next steps may involve seeing a counselor, eating disorder clinics, or eventually seeing a registered dietitian.  If you see the signs in a friend and want to help, Doxsee said it’s important to be patient and come from a place of concern.\r\n\r\n“Say what you see, don’t make any quick judgements,” she said, adding that an example would be tocomment how they seem tired or have less energy.\r\n\r\n“If they’re not ready, always keep that door open so they know you can be someone they can approach.”\r\n\r\nFor further advice, Doxsee recommends calling HCDS to speak to one of the counselors. You can also provide additional support by accompanying someone as they attend appointments.\r\n\r\n“They’re so common in this age range, if you can be that one person of support for someone, that’s reason enough to learn about it.”\r\n\r\nDoxsee said the more people know about eating disorders, the chances of people getting help are much greater.\r\n\r\n“It has such a high death rate, which may be something people forget,” she said. “It’s complex, but important to talk about.”  \r\n\r\n<strong>Warning signs to watch for, in yourself or in a friend</strong>\r\n\r\nAnorexia\r\n\r\n•\tNot consuming food often—skipping meals, avoiding mealtimes with friends\r\n\r\n•\tDrastic loss of weight\r\n\r\n•\tGet cold much easier due to lack of insulation in the body\r\n\r\n•\tHair falls out from lack of nutrition\r\n\r\n•\tFatigued, tired and weak\r\n\r\n•\tVery rigid workout schedule—up to four hours a day, even if sick or have other things to do\r\n\r\n•\tPreoccupied with food and calories from moment of waking up to moment of going to bed\r\n\r\nBulimia\r\n\r\n•\tPreoccupied with food and calories\r\n\r\n•\tMore likely to stay close to current weight\r\n\r\n•\tExcuse themselves after meals\r\n\r\n•\tMay smell of vomit, have laxatives around\r\n\r\n•\tBloodshot eyes\r\n\r\n•\tEnamel on the teeth begins to wear away\r\n\r\n•\tScars on knuckles\r\n\r\n<strong>Tips on how to stay positive</strong>\r\n\r\nWith pressure from the media and our peers’ preoccupation with dieting, it can be difficult to maintain a healthy body image and healthy habits in today’s society. Personal Trainer and Lifestyle Consultant Pam Fountas offered tips on how to keep ourselves in check when thinking about our bodies:\r\n\r\n•\t<strong>Treat your body as an instrument, not an ornament</strong>- Value your body for what it can do, not just what it appears to be. Reflect on what your body does for you on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n•\t<strong>Take care of your body</strong>- Learn about what your body really needs rather than the next new diet. Focus on being healthier rather than thinner.\r\n\r\n•\t<strong>Challenge the values of today’s society</strong>- Be aware of the culture at large that is trying to make us feel insecure so that we buy products so they can make money. There’s a social influence we need to be aware of.\r\n\r\n•\t<strong>Set objective goals</strong>- Rather than setting goals about its external appearance, think about what your body could do. For example, try a new challenge like yoga.  •\tBe realistic about your body’s genetics- Embrace your body as it is now.\r\n\r\n•\t<strong>Think of time wasted and energy directed</strong>- Re-channel the energy you put into feeling about how you look and redirect it towards something positive.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-05-15 09:20:04.684194-04	2012-03-16 18:21:05-04	2012-03-16 18:21:05-04	t

264	The Brew	42	thebrew	643		Allegedly discovered around 2700 B.C. in China, tea is the most popular prepared drink in the world. Sometimes said to be food for thought, tea has found itself warming the hands of every generation—in contemplation, as part of social gathering or a staple in late night relaxation. Kingston has a number of locations that brew bagged n’ ready or loose leaf tea for students. \r\n\r\nTea is derived from the Camellia Sinensis or Thea Sinensis plant and classified as being either black, green, oolong or white.\r\nHerbal teas use dried fruits, flowers, roots and leaves to create a unique, decaffeinated blend.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have yet to find a time where the diverse beverage is not a source of comfort and delight. Last winter, confined by the snowy weather, I found myself bored with my stocked tea shelf. In a half-ditch effort to evade studying and brew something new, I began mixing the leaves and creating unique favourites. Here I will be reviewing tea from local sources and posting directions to steep an easy blend of your own. \r\n\r\nThis weekend I’ll be sampling some of fall’s flavours. I’m searching for October's perfect brews: herbal tea to calm mid-term nerves and caffeinated blends for a morning boost.	t	t	2012-05-15 09:18:32.215132-04	2010-10-23 21:22:34-04	2010-10-23 21:22:34-04	t
265	Cran-Apple for Your Thoughts	42	cran-apple-your-thoughts	643		<p>Cranberry Apple (Tea Store; 241 Princess Street, Kingston)</p><img src="http://www.queensjournal.ca/media/stories/v138/i0/cranberry-apple.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Cranberry Apple">\r\n\r\nType: Herbal\r\nIngredients: Dried apple, hibiscus, rosehip and sweet orange peel.\r\n\r\nServing size: One tea spoon to one full mug of water.\r\n\r\nRaw aroma: Very sweet. Strong notes of apple, light cranberry and rosehip. \r\n\r\nBrewing aroma: Citrusy. Smells of cleaning product.\r\n\r\nSteeping time: 8 minutes (I steep between seven to ten minutes for a strong herbal). \r\n\r\nRemember: Don’t steep tea with freshly boiled water. Instead, pour the desired amount into a cup and let it cool for a minute or so. Hot water can burn tea leaves and distort the taste; this is often to blame for herbal teas which come out bitter.\r\n\r\nMy first sip of the now cloudy purple/red cup was bland. The second instantly gave me a rush of citrus and went down tasting slightly of cider. A few gulps in and the flavour has settled into a cranberry orange blend with only a faint apple aftertaste. \r\n\r\nOverall, it’s a mediocre cup of tea. It certainly isn’t awful but I wouldn’t serve it to anyone with a fussy palate. Light and decaffeinated, I would probably drink this with a basic hummus-and-pita sort of lunch. Frankly, the brewing aroma was too reminiscent of Mr. Clean to make me comfortable with the first sip. \r\n\r\n<b>Verdict</b>: 3/10\r\n\r\nUpdate: I steeped my next cup for ten minutes and it improved the taste slightly. Much stronger notes of apple. <b>Verdict</b>: 4/10.	t	t	2012-05-15 09:19:09.588671-04	2010-10-23 21:29:05-04	2010-10-23 21:29:05-04	t
361	Water wellness	32	water-wellness	589	aqua fitness, student fitness, health, exercise	By Carolyn Flanagan\r\nAssistant Blogs Editor\r\n\r\nSadly misinterpreted as a seniors’ sport, most students overlook the water as a valuable way to get exercise. The Journal spoke to Tiffany Bambrick, co-ordinator of fitness and wellness at the ARC and a certified water fitness instructor, about the benefits of aquatic fitness.\r\n<!--image:"aquafitness"-->\r\n\r\n<strong>No impact</strong>- Exercising in the water does not create impact on your joints, unlike running or cross-training.\r\n\r\n<strong>Good for injury recovery</strong>-Because of its low impact on joints, swimming is an ideal workout if recovering from an injury. In fact, if you have been training, you can maintain your cardio-vascular capacity for up to four to six weeks if you continue to exercise in the water.\r\n\r\n<strong>Adds variety</strong>- Not everyone likes running, the gym or the bike. Variety is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In the water, you can swim lengths, tread water, run, take a class or even do resistance training, to name a few.  Any activity can be adapted to the water.\r\n\r\n<strong>Use equipment</strong>-Flutter boards, pool noodles, water belts and dumb-bells (with foam core) can all be used in an aquatic workout. In addition, your own body and the properties of water can provide resistance on their own.\r\n\r\n<strong>Varsity athletes are also doing it</strong>- Cardio, flexibility, strength and conditioning and all other components of a regular work out can be found in an aqua fitness class. Contrary to popular belief, you can work up a sweat in a pool.\r\n\r\n<strong>You can make it your own</strong>- The ARC offers classes in aquatic fitness that you can modify to do on your own if the group setting isn’t for you.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fun</strong>- If you enjoy the water, that is. You can be uninhibited and let loose in the water.\r\n\r\nCasual swim times at the ARC\r\n\r\n<em>Monday: 7:30 to 8:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., 4 to 7 p.m. (Fridays until 8 p.m.)</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Saturday to Sunday: 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., 4 to 6 p.m., 9 to 10:30 p.m.</em>\r\n\r\nAquatic Fitness Plus Class\r\n\r\n<em>Tuesday/Thursday 4:30 to 5:15 p.m.</em>\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-05-15 09:19:40.749144-04	2012-03-16 19:40:15-04	2012-03-16 19:40:15-04	t
357	Another year, another resolution	32	another-year-another-resolution	589	New year's resolutions, fitness, health	By Rachel Hunter\r\nContributor\r\n\r\nJanuary was the judgment month as New Year’s resolutions stayed at the forefront of everyone’s mind.  It’s no surprise that many resolutions begin with goals towards a change in lifestyle, such as a change in diet or increasing exercise.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"fitness1"-->\r\n\r\nAs we move into the second month of resolutions, it can be easy to fall off track as the year gets busier and priorities change.\r\n\r\nAccording to Derek Wiggan, a fitness supervisor from Queen’s Athletics and Recreation, it’s never too late to turn around your fitness habits or get back on track. The key is in creating smart fitness goals.\r\n\r\n<strong>Starting out</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen creating realistic fitness goals there are a few important tips to remember.\r\n\r\n1)\tBe patient\r\n\r\n“Treat it as a goal, not a race,” Wiggan said.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem when creating fitness goals is that people aren’t patient enough to see the results.  Make sure when you’re looking at your current fitness level and comparing it to your ideal level you take into consideration the time and effort it takes to get there.\r\n\r\n2)\tStart off easy\r\n\r\nDon’t shock your body.\r\n\r\n“People often go too hard and force themselves into a workout their body isn’t ready for,” Wiggan said. “This just causes them to burn out faster and lose motivation.”\r\n\r\n3)\tComfort is key\r\n\r\nThere are countless ways to begin achieving one’s desired fitness level.\r\n\r\n“If you aren’t a treadmill person, don’t force yourself on it,” Wiggan said.\r\n\r\nStart with something you will feel good doing.\r\n\r\n4)\tLeave time for rest\r\n\r\n“Pace yourself.” As important as it is to challenge yourself, you must be rested in order to achieve your maximum potential.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fitness at home</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are also countless opportunities around the house to keep you motivated.\r\n\r\n-\tPush- ups while watching TV. \r\n\r\nThis way you won’t feel as bad about procrastinating.\r\n\r\n-\tUse music to motivate you.\r\n\r\n“While exercising at home, listen to your iPod. It will help you to stay motivated and to keep on doing those crunches until the end of the song,” Wiggan said.\r\n\r\n-\tInvest in affordable equipment.\r\n\r\n“Go buy a bar you can mount to a door frame for chin ups. It’s easy to do a few reps every time you walk through the door,” Wiggan said. “Skipping ropes are also very affordable and easy to do inside and out.”\r\n\r\n-\tKeep things in your view.\r\n\r\nFor example, leave your shoes by your door or your yoga mat by your bed. By leaving these objects visually accessible you will be more inclined to use them.\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-05-15 09:20:21.093446-04	2012-02-14 00:20:51-05	2012-02-14 00:20:51-05	t

368	The Hottest Movies of the Summer	27	hottest-movies-summer	882	Movies, summer, popular, comedy, romance, 	When we think of summer fun in the sun, staying inside is not necessarily what typically comes to mind. But on rainy days or sleepy afternoons, it’s a good idea to curl up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn and a summer flick. Here are our top five must-watch picks for this summer.  \r\n\r\n<!--image:"lime1"-->\r\n\r\n1.    Midnight in Paris: : The opening scene alone makes the film worth watching if you are looking for some European inspiration. The whimsical story is unexpected; the film has an imaginative and unique twist that left us in awe of the scenic summer Parisian nights, all the while laughing at Owen Wilson’s comedic timing. A definite must see if you plan on travelling to France or are a Woody Allen fan.\r\n<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/">Summary and Trailer </a>\r\n\r\n2.   We Bought A Zoo: Heart-warming and perfect for a summer movie night; it made us want to go outside and stargaze. Matt Damon plays a lovable Dad to one of the cutest little girls we’ve ever seen. The two have great chemistry in the film, and we really felt there was on-screen father-daughter connection between the two actors. The landscape, animals, and ever-present sunshine of the film are uplifting. A  perfect counterbalance to the emotional underlying storyline of the film.\r\n<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/">Summary and Trailer </a>\r\n\r\n3.   Eat Pray Love:A unique story perfect for those needing some inspiration to get off the couch and see the world this summer, even if it means stepping out to your local gelato shop and pretending you’re in Italy. Julia Roberts depicts a woman who is stifled by her marriage and busy North American lifestyle. Her solution? Travel to new and exotic places. Whether indulging in a pasta dish in Rome, or conversing with an ancient and eccentric medicine man, the movie is entertaining and reassuring that even when things get tough, there is always room for growth.\r\n<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0879870/">Summary and Trailer \r\n</a>\r\n\r\n4.   Project X: and ridiculous, yet so entertaining, the film follows a trio of awkward outcasts who are determined to gain social status, and attempt to do so by throwing a massive house party. You can’t help but feel sorry for the main character, and yet you don’t want the shenanigans to end. Though the handheld camera was dizzying at times, the movie made me feel like I was in the heart of the party, and the music was upbeat and energizing. It also made me nostalgic of my high school partying years — perfect to see with a bunch of friends on a lazy Sunday night (pizza and chips optional).\r\n<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1636826/">Summary and Trailer </a>\r\n\r\n5.   21 Jump Street: We can’t get enough of Jonah Hill. In one of his best roles yet, he co-stars with Channing Tatum in a comedy about two mediocre police officers whose task is to act as undercover high school students. Equally enjoyed by guys and girls, finally a quality comedy that has quality humour, the dialogue between the two actors had us laughing from start to finish. A great movie choice for a summer date night. \r\n<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232829/">Summary and Trailer </a>\r\n\r\n	f	t	2012-05-27 12:00:14.220133-04	2012-05-27 11:21:45.37086-04	\N	f
366	Steer Clear of the Summer 15	32	steer-clear-summer-15	883	Summer, fitness, weight loss, snacks, food,  	<!--image:"fitness11"-->\r\nSo you think you survived the Freshman 15? Well, meet its counterpart: the Summer 15. Though cafeteria food may be behind us, summertime has its fair share of indulgences. Be it BBQs, nightly ice-cream trips, camp food, or patio drinks (alcoholic or not), summer can be equally challenging for maintaining a healthy weight.  Follow these easy snack ideas to keep those pesky pounds at bay for beach season!\r\n\r\n1.\tIt’s all about the grazing. Rather than eating 3 heavy meals a day, try having small, healthy snacks spread throughout the day instead. Keep a bag of your favorite Kashi bars or a bag of almonds (best when toasted) at your convenience and snack on that whenever you are feeling a tad bit hungry. Even Sofia Vergara from the hit TV show Modern Family agrees that people should eat “Not too much food . . . Everything in moderation”. (Courtesy of: FitSugar.com http://www.fitsugar.com/Sofia-Vergara-Fitness-Diet-Routine-18374391)\r\n\r\n2.\t If you get the munchies. When you feel the need to keep your hands busy at your work place, try going to a specialty Tea Store and getting a flavour of tea that interests you. Feel free to experiment! Try the chocolate flavors, berry flavors, or green tea (I drink that twice a day!). This way you are getting what you crave without adding those pesky calories. You can also go for a latte (decaf optional); ask for skim milk and if available choose sugar-free syrups such as vanilla or hazelnut. The flavour will give you a pick-me-up, and the milk is satisfying and a great source of calcium. What’s more, we often mistake thirst for hunger, so sipping a tea or latte mid-afternoon may do the trick at easing those afternoon cravings.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"fitness2"--> <!--image:"fitness3"-->\r\n\r\n3.\tAvoid those starches. Muffins are just cupcakes with a healthier title…don’t be fooled by the “whole grain” title; often a small whole-wheat bagel with peanut butter and jam has fewer calories and more nutrients! Try avoiding white flour (which makes you feel bloated anyways) and reach for whole-wheat, whole foods such as pita and hummus and cook with whole-wheat pasta (we found it very palatable). If you want more of a crunch grab slices of cucumber and hummus, or try whole-wheat Wheat Thins for a movie snack rather than traditional potato chips.\r\n\r\n<!--image:"fitness5"-->\r\n\r\n4.\tEnjoy your sweets. If you deprive yourself of what you love, it will make bingeing virtually inevitable. Treats are perfectly fine as long as you watch your portions. Frozen yogurt is an excellent option to get hooked on for the summer, and with the new Froyo trend it won’t be hard to come by. Want to make your own?  Use fat-free Greek yogurt with a fruit bottom and mix so the fruit is distributed. Put the yogurt in a Ziploc bag and cut a small corner off. Take a cookie sheet and place a piece of parchment or wax paper on it. Just like icing, make tiny little dots with the yogurt (about the size of a loony) and then freeze it. There you have it, the perfect snack!\r\n\r\n<!--image:"fitness6"-->\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least: \r\n5.\tStay Hydrated! Avoid those pesky sodas (It is essentially liquid sugar). Keep a large bottle of water with you at all times and drink, drink, drink! This will flush your system of toxins and also help with weight maintenance. If you find it challenging to drink the recommended 8 glasses of water per day, make it more appealing by adding lemon juice, or choose Perrier as your dock drink of choice, or if you’re ordering at a restaurant.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you follow these easy tips, you will feel healthy, satisfied, and happy, both inside and out!\r\n\r\n	t	t	2012-05-29 09:25:00.837668-04	2012-05-29 09:21:58-04	2012-05-29 09:21:58-04	t

Usually these zoos have a lower operating budget so they welcome volunteers. They may even offer employment by using your volunteer experience. Senior volunteers depending on their experience may have the opportunity to work side by with a keeper.\r\n\r\nThe staff will love the extra hands on deck and the work is fascinating because you get to learn so much about each animal while watching them closely. If you volunteer in the spring or summer time it will be more beneficial because most of the animals will be having their young (and nothing is cuter than a baby kangaroo or a baby Bengal tiger).\r\n\r\nHere are two zoos that offer a volunteer program:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.safariniagara.com/?page_id=30">Safari Niagara</a> – Stevensville (Close to Niagara Falls), ON (Privately owned)\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.torontozoo.com/SupportTheZoo/BecomeAVolunteer.asp">Toronto Zoo</a> – Toronto, ON (Publically owned)\r\n\r\nBut don’t stop here, if have a zoo close to where you live, drop them an email to see if they offer a chance for you to volunteer.\r\n\r\nTake it from me it, a summer at the zoo was the best summer of my life!\r\n\r\n<!--image:"yolo5"-->\r\n\r\n	f	t	2012-05-27 11:47:46.180358-04	2012-05-27 11:43:39.494254-04	\N	f
370	Summer in Kingston 	32	summer-kingston	891		The idea of spending a summer in Kingston is often met with dread. Surely, when students clear out the city we call home during the school year is a ghost town, right? Whether this is your first summer in the city or your fourth, the <em> Journal’s</em> here to prove that a quieter Kingston doesn’t have to mean a more boring one.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlay\r\n\r\n •     The club scene is a little different over the summer months, but Stages’ Beach Slam on Monday nights and the occasional summer Alfie’s are some of the most popular nights of the season.\r\n\r\n•      Just because its summer doesn’t mean classics such as Karaoke at Tir Nan Og aren’t a regular occurrence. Vocalize your chops as you get a chance to mingle with the locals and students in Kingston for summer.\r\n\r\n•     If you’re a sports fan, enjoy playoffs at bars around town such as The Ale House Canteen, The Brass, Fanatics, The Pilot House and many others.\r\n\r\n•      Kingston’s annual Buskers Festival attracts tourists from all across the province. Don’t miss it this year – it’s happening from July 12-15.\r\n\r\n•      Wolfe Island has a beach! Big Sandy Bay is just a 30-minute bike ride or a short drive away once you get off the ferry.\r\n\r\n•     Also on Wolfe Island is the annual music festival. This year it’s Aug. 10-11. Check out <a href="http://www.wolfislandmusicfestival.com">wolfislandmusicfestival.com</a> for the lineup.\r\n\r\n•     Drive-in theatres are not only things you see in movies. Impress your date or plan a night out with your friends at Kingston’s very own Family Funworld. Check out: <a href="http://www.funworldpark.com/drive-in.php">funworldpark.com/drive-in.php</a> for movie times.\r\n\r\n Eat\r\n\r\n •     Enjoy the sun as you indulge in summer treats in downtown’s many restaurant patios and rooftops. Whether its season favourites such as Lonestars’ Margaritaville or the new Jack Astor’s (which opens in July), this summer essential is a can’t-miss.\r\n\r\n•     Kingston’s recently seen an infiltration of frozen yogurt and ice-cream shops. Many of them lace around the lake, so stop by when you need to cool down. Some popular options are Menchies, Spin Desert Cafe, White Mountain, Mio Gelato, or the ever-convenient Metro gelateria.\r\n\r\n•     During the summer months many popular restaurants take a hiatus. If one of your regulars have closed shop for the student drought, you can take on the art of cooking up a classic summer barbeque. Add in a couple of close friends and a dash of summer tunes and you’ve got a recipe for success.\r\n\r\n•     If you’re low on cash, pack a picnic basket and head to the lake for some old-fashioned delicious fun. Don’t forget the apple pie!\r\n\r\n If you want to know more about Kingston in the summer, stay tuned for the next blog post on "Summer In Kingston" featuring the sections of Learn, and Breathe.\r\n\r\nSee you next week, I'm off to grab me some Menchies! 	f	t	2012-05-27 11:56:00.70595-04	2012-05-27 11:56:00.699428-04	\N	f

The editor(s)-in-chief and the Op-Ed editor have a responsibility to provide this service, while protecting the readership against misuse of it, including but not limited to libel, untruths, and plagiarism.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.02</strong>\tAny letter or essay of opinion may be edited for brevity, clarity, relevance, legality, truthfulness, and good taste.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.03\t</strong>Members of editorial board may not write essays of opinion or letters to the editor. </p>\r\n<p><strong>6.04\t</strong>All effort should be made to print every letter as soon as possible after it is received.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.05\t</strong>All effort should be made to ensure that letters are attributed to the true author, and the author’s full name given, along with their year and discipline, position at Queen’s, or home city. To this end, letters should be submitted with a phone number or registered Queen’s email address.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.06\t</strong>Anonymity may be given at the discretion of the editor(s)-in-chief, provided he/she/they know the author’s identity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.07\t</strong>The letters section is not a message board.

This document will be used as a guideline in the day-to-day running of the newspaper. The purpose of this document is to provide readers and staff with a clear picture of how information is collected, reported and distributed by the Journal. It also serves as a preventative measure against real or perceived conflict of interest. The guide applies to editors as well as editorial staff, and any member of the business office if they become involved in an editorial situation to which the guide applies.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Journal staff and contributors (henceforth referred to as journalists) in every capacity associated with the Journal, will strive to collect, edit, and distribute information in an impartial, objective manner. Journalists will not report or refuse to report a story based on personal matters such as conflicts or special relationships, except in cases where such matters constitute a conflict of interest.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Journalists will never deny or attempt to disguise their relationship with the Journal. A Journal reporter or photographer will always identify themselves as such when meeting anyone for the purposes of a Journal article. Journalists will never ask an interview subject a question or use quotes from a conversation unless the subject understands the information is to be used in an article.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Journalists will always allow an interview subject time to discuss any points he or she feels the journalist didn’t cover in the interview.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In the context of a small university setting, journalists must be allowed to engage in social relationships with people they have interviewed or may interview in the future. However, journalists should refrain from letting social relationships interfere with the way they cover a story. Journalists should never cover a story in which they have a significant personal stake, such a story about a significant other or a club the journalist happens to chair. \r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Journalists will not use gifts to obtain interviews or other material pertinent to a story. They will also not accept gifts valued at more than $15 from interview subjects or others related to a story.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Journalists should refrain from obtaining any form of information “off the record.” However, if such information is obtained, it is never to be used in an article or discussed with anyone other than the Journal’s lawyer. Information obtained “not for attribution” can be used in an article, but must not include any information that would identify the source. Again, such information should be avoided. Journalists should always explain these terms to interview subjects.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The onus is always on the Journal to prove facts printed in the newspaper. As such, no article should ever contain overheard information, hearsay, or anonymous information that cannot be independently confirmed. Journalists will attempt to independently confirm any information, even if it comes from a source considered credible.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Journalists will never give non-Journal employees access to full articles before those articles appear in print. \r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li> The Journal’s financial well being, especially advertising concerns, should never interfere with a journalist’s ability to do his or her job.

10	/webadvertising/	Web Advertising	<center><em>Thank you for expressing interest in advertising with the Queen's Journal Online Edition</em></center>\r\n\r\nIncluded below is the website's online advertising policy:\r\n\r\n<strong>Advertising Rates:</strong>\r\nCurrently, the Queen's Journal Online Edition's advertising works on a rotational system. Each day's worth of advertising purchased, guarantees - but is not limited to - your advertisement being served to at least 1000 (one thousand) <strong>IMPRESSIONS</strong> per day. This rate represents our base <em>cost per thousand impressions</em> (CPM) - a commonly accepted internet standard used when charging for online advertising through serving image ads. \r\n\r\nOur prices below are quoted as fixed rates which have been determined to reflect fair online pricing. However, purchase of our advertising service is in actuality a <em>shared-tenancy system</em>. We believe that this is beneficial to advertisers. Based on the daily visitor traffic the Online Edition receives, this system has been calibrated to ensure the <strong>guaranteed</strong> 1000 impressions per day for the specified fixed rate.\r\n\r\nThe cost of our advertising locations depends on the ad position as well as duration for which you choose to run your advertisement. All rates listed below are on a weekly basis, applying our base CPM rate over a period of 7 (seven) full days:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Location 1) - 468 x 60<sub>px</sub> Banner - $28.00/week - <em>or just 2.5 impressions per penny</em></li>\r\n\t<li>Location 2) - 160 x 600<sub>px</sub> Wide Skyscraper - $21.00/week - 3.3 <em>impressions per penny</em></li>\r\n\t<li>Location 3) - 728 x 90<sub>px</sub> Leaderboard- $17.50/week - 4 <em>impressions per penny</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Ad Locations:</strong>\r\nWe offer advertisers three distinct advertisement locations on the site:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Our 468 x 60 pixels ‘Banner’ space located at the top, centre of the page is displayed between the website's 'breadcrumb' navigation and before any inherent content. This ad location is 'above the fold' and can be viewed for every page on the website, no matter the viewer's browser resolution.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The next location is the 160 x 600 pixels 'Wide Skyscraper' located on the right-hand site of the content, below the website's navigation menu. This ad location also appears on every page of the website.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The final location is a 728 x 90 pixels 'Leaderboard' location at the bottom of the page. This location appears after the content, and before the footer menu. This ad location too, appears on every page of the website.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Per-Diem Advertising:</strong>\r\nOur advertising slots are currently sold by the week. However, we do understand that there are many potential advertisers looking to advertise for single days.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we include an additional service charge for the required daily management of the advertiser's campaigns.\r\n\r\nWe offer the following per-diem slots. The rates below are given as a standard rate per day:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Location 1) - 468 x 60<sub>px</sub> Banner - $10.00/day</li>\r\n\t<li>Location 2) - 160 x 600<sub>px</sub> Wide Skyscraper - $8.00/day</li>\r\n\t<li>Location 3) - 728 x 90<sub>px</sub> Leaderboard- $6.50/day</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Ad Location Availability:</strong>\r\nDue to the nature of our rotational advertising display and guaranteed impressions, there is limited availability for each ad location at any given time.\r\n\r\nTo avoid schedule conflict problems, we require advertisers to reserve their desired ad location and time at least <strong>ONE WEEK</strong> in advance. Requests for advertising slots received with less than the indicated amount of advanced notice will not be accepted, and we will require you to choose a later time slot.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Methods of Payment:</strong>\r\nPayment must be made by cash or cheque in full. New advertisers must make the full payment PRIOR to the beginning of your target date of placement.\r\nRepeat customers may be billed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Ad Specifics:</strong>\r\nAll ads must be sent at least one week prior to the target date of placement (at the last possible time to reserve a target date) and must be in one of the following formats: <strong>PNG, GIF, or JPEG</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Additional Resources:</strong>\r\nTo see statistical information for the Online Edition of the Queen's Journal, we encourage you to visit our public traffic statistics, available at: <a href="http://www.queensjournal.ca/trafficstats/" target=new>www.queensjournal.ca/trafficstats/</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>How To Order:</strong>\r\nBefore placing an order, be sure to have the following prepared:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Target date of placement</li>\r\n<li>Duration of your desired advertisement campaign</li>\r\n<li>Preferred ad location</li>\r\n<li>Your predetermined ad graphic or a detailed request for our graphic design services</li>\r\n<li>Preferred method of payment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>With the above information ready please phone 613-533-6711 or email <a href="mailto:journal_business@ams.queensu.ca">journal_business@ams.queensu.ca</a></strong>\r\n	f		f

Try some out with your partner, whether it’s a summer separation or a lengthier long-distance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Synchtube</strong>\r\n\r\nSynchtube.com is just one site that helps people on separate computers watch videos at the same time. Now you can share the experience of watching cat videos while you’re in different countries.\r\n\r\n<strong>Read a book</strong>\r\n\r\nPick a book and take turns reading it to each other over Skype or phone. This is ideal for people in different time zones ­— you can fall asleep to the sound of each other’s voice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Watch a movie</strong>\r\n\r\nDownload the same movie, start it at the same time and put Skype on its audio function. Now it’s like you’re watching a movie in the same room — annoying questions and obnoxious laughter included.\r\n\r\n<strong>Send flowers</strong>\r\n\r\nFind a florist in your partner’s area that will let you order over the phone. You can set a time and date for the delivery just in time for a special day, like a birthday or anniversary.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mail a journal</strong>\r\n\r\nSend a notebook back and forth, filling it with notes or artwork. When you reunite, it can act as a record of your time apart.\r\n\r\n<strong>Get busy </strong>\r\n\r\nFact: some of us like sex. Don’t lose out — just get creative with your voice and your long distance phone plan. If you don’t want to leave things to your imagination, try Skype to skip the “what are you wearing” jargon.\r\n\r\n<em>— Janina Enrile</em>

169	It will have no major impact.	42
170	It is too far from campus	43
171	It is a great music venue	43
172	What is Fort Henry?	43
173	I am excited to learn!	44
174	I am looking forward to seeing all of my friends again.	44
175	I am nervous about beginning my new courses.	44

177	I am dreading the new school year.	44
178	Excellent idea!	45
179	The Village sounds more appropriate.	45

181	I am indifferent.  	45
182	Ridiculous idea.	45
183	Unethical.	46
184	Outrageous.	46
185	A waste of money.	46
186	It's good way to get the classes that I want.	46
187	Fair.	46
188	All the time.  In fact, I never get anything done.	47
189	Quite often.  I'm not very organized.	47
190	Sometimes.  	47
191	Hardly ever. I try to stay on top of things.	47
192	Never.  I get all of my work done ahead of time.	47

199	It's time to party!	49
200	Homecoming?  It's this weekend?	49
201	I'll be hitting the books. 	49
202	I will be out of town.	49
203	It should be turned into a family carnival by having a concert.	50
204	Safer regulations should be instituted.	50
205	Have a sanctioned party to create a safer environment.	50
206	Host a street party with admission limited to Queen's students and alumni.	50
207	Completely eliminate house parties.	50
208	Watching Queen's beat Western at the Football game.	51
209	Talking to Queen's alumni.	51
210	Going to Aberdeen on Saturday night.	51
211	Studying in an empty and solitary library.	51
212	Spending the weekend as far away from Homecoming events as possible.	51
213	I am behind in my readings and I haven't gone to any lectures.	52
214	I am mentally preparing myself for pulling an all-nighter at Stauffer.	52
215	I have been studying for weeks and am well prepared.  Bring them on!	52
216	Midterms? I don't have any.	52
217	Midterms are easy and I am not stressed out at all.	52
218	It makes me ashamed to be Canadian. Do we have no standards?	53
219	I hope the Conservatives lose the upcoming election because of this.	53
220	I cannot believe Prime Minister Stephen Harper did not take the blame for it. 	53
221	The speech writers should take the blame for it.	53
222	What happened?	53
223	I've watched the debates, done my research, and now I'm ready to vote!	54
224	I don't feel as informed as I should be, but I'm still casting my ballot.	54
225	I don't understand the platforms of the different candidates and have no idea who to vote for.	54
226	I don't see how this year's election will change anything.	54
227	Elections? Politics is not my thing.	54
228	I'm refreshed and roaring to go!	55
229	The weekend should have been longer.	55
230	After our family gathering, I realized why I moved away to go to school.	55
231	I'm American. I still have to wait a couple of weeks for my turkey.	55
232	Thanksgiving? I did not have time to be thankful because I was too busy studying for midterms.	55
233	I expected the Conservatives to win a minority government and I am pleased with the results.	56
234	I am glad that Liberal Peter Milliken won for the seventh time!	56
235	I wanted the NDP to win this election.	56
236	I wanted the Green Party to win this election.	56
237	I wanted the Bloc Québécois to win this election.	56
238	It is inevitable due to the economic downturn.	57
239	It doesn't faze me. Mom and Dad pay for my university tuition.	57
240	This is a chance for Harper to prove his concern for our education.	57
241	Students should be cautious with their investments.	57
242	I am in debt anyways. 	57
243	Excellent! This means I will have a shorter wait time.	58
331	I still don't know what it means to be a Canadian.	75
244	It will allow nursing and medicine students to have first-hands experience in their field of study.	58
245	It will better accommodate my ultra-busy schedule.	58
246	I am never sick so I am indifferent.  	58
247	I don't want to pay an extra $3.75 mandatory fee.	58
248	I love it! I can get anywhere, and all I need to do is flash my student card.	59
572	Only if it's before noon.	133
249	It is convenient, especially when it is rainy and cold outside.	59
250	I prefer walking, jogging, or biking. 	59
251	The bus system is too complex. Taxi!!	59
252	I would appreciate a later bus service.	59
253	It has helped shape Canada's position in world politics.	60
254	It reflects a good relationship between the member states.	60
255	It should be reformed.	60
256	It favours American interests over Canadian and Mexican interests.	60
257	NAFTA? What's that?	60
258	Candy, candy, candy!  	61
259	My costume was wicked.	61
260	I loved pumpkin carving!	61
261	I ate too much sugar, and now I feel sick.	61
262	Halloween is so tacky.  It is the worst holiday of the year.	61
263	Yay for change!	62
264	I am glad Obama won, but now he has high standards to live up to.	62
265	While I don't take sides, I really enjoyed the energy of this election.	62
266	I was hoping for McCain to win.	62
267	I have not followed any of the US elections coverage.	62
268	I am as energetic as ever.  Nothing can stop me now!	63
269	I am enjoying my classes, and I feel confident about my exams.	63
270	I am behind in my readings and have too many assignments.	63
271	I have missed far too many lectures and have no idea what is being taught in my courses.	63
272	I want coffee. I want sleep.	63
273	I fully support it, as I believe this is a temporary solution for safety issues revolving around the Aberdeen Street party.	64
274	I am not completely opposed to the decision; however, I do think there may have been better alternatives.	64
275	I am neither for or against the decision.	64
276	I do not think this will have any effect whatsoever on the Queen's student body.  Future Aberdeen parties are inevitable.	64
277	I believe this most negatively affects Queen's alumni, who will not have the chance to go to the Queen's football game or meet current students.	64
278	I am looking forward to a large family gathering.  I miss home!	65
279	I am baking Christmas cookies and building a scrumptious gingerbread house! Yum!!	65
280	I am excited about my New Year's Resolutions.  I promise to stick to them this time.	65
281	Celebrate?  I'm just taking time off and becoming a couch potato for two weeks.	65
282	I am staying in Kingston.  The campus will be so peaceful and quiet!	65
283	Fantastic!  I missed my friends and I am excited to be back.	66
284	Back to reality... I am already stressed about schoolwork.	66
285	I miss home. The winter break went by too quickly.	66
286	Dreadful. I am looking forward to reading break.	66
287	I stayed here during the break, so the only thing that changed is that there is now traffic on the University Avenue sidewalk.	66
288	It is a fantastic resource for students that increases student-professor interaction.	67
289	WebCT is a life saver. Why bother going to lectures?	67
290	It requires a set of standard rules and guidelines for monitoring purposes.	67
291	I would prefer having more face-to-face interaction with my professor.  I do not like online discussion forums.	67
292	I hate anything that requires me to turn on a computer.	67
293	Spending time with his family	68
294	Reflecting on his presidency	68
295	Planning a news show on FOX	68
296	On vacation	68
297	Choking on a pretzel	68
298	Keeping facutly societies happy.	69
299	Race-relations and diversity on campus.	69
300	Dealing with the Queen's Centre.	69
301	Making AMS operations more environmetally sustainable.	69
302	Lowering student fees.	69
303	The food is delicious. There is also so much variety!	70
304	The food is good, but the lineups take forever.	70
305	The food is alright, but it is certainly overpriced.	70
306	I wish it was not mandatory for main campus residents.	70
307	Meal plan? What have they planned? I need to go on a year-long detox.	70
308	I feel very informed and I am excited to vote!	71
309	I have done my research, but I still don't know who to vote for.	71
310	I should probably do more research before Tuesday.	71
311	I feel like the most ignorant student on campus. I'll probably just vote for the names I recognize on the ballot sheet.	71
312	Elections? What? When? 	71
313	Handling the budget	72
314	The Queen's Centre	72
315	Improving relations between Queen's students and Kingston residents	72
316	Increasing funding for clubs	72
317	Making Kingston transit more efficient	72
318	Very pleased.	73
319	I saw it coming.	73
320	Surprised. This is not what I had expected.	73
321	Furious.	73
322	I am indifferent. 	73
323	Stauffer is my new habitat 24/7. Coffee is the new water.	74
324	CoGro is my scene. I'm just really keen.	74
325	I go to the library to download DC++ movies. Sometimes I study. That is, when I feel like it.	74
326	Chill out. It's all good. 	74
327	Midterms? What midterms?	74
328	I love it. I'm very patriotic.	75
329	I grew up singing it every morning at school. It's now a part of my childhood memories.	75
330	It's alright but a bit outdated. 	75
332	I'm not Canadian, so I'm indifferent.	75
333	Delighting in scrumptious comfort food, such as brownies and ice cream.	76
334	Watching my all-time favourite movie.	76
335	Doing something athletic, like going for a jog, taking a yoga class, among others.	76
336	Nervously chewing my nails and breaking my pencil by pressing too hard.	76
337	Stress? Relax, man. It's all good.	76
338	I'm going home sweet home.	77
339	I am travelling overseas with friends and/or family.	77
340	I'm working on essays, homework, assignments and studying for exams.	77
341	I'm staying in Kingston.	77
342	I have no idea. Who plans that far in advance?	77
343	What?!? It was fake? I thought I was going to get kicked out of Victoria Hall!	78
344	I enjoyed reading their story for Postscript.	78
345	I liked the sports column on Athletes of the Week.	78
346	I attempted to do the cross-word puzzle until I realized something was really messed up.	78
347	I was excited that Homecoming was back!	78
348	It is a fair assessment of my work and effort.	79
349	It is too difficult to get a good grade and I am worried about applying to Grad school.	79
350	While I am here to learn - not to get an A on everything - it is discouraging to get low grades.	79
351	The grades are arbitrary and do not reflect the quality of my dedication and intelligence.	79
352	Grades? Who cares!	79
353	I think that there should be a permanent Beaver Tail stand at Queen's.	80
354	I really enjoyed my Beaver Tail - even though it took up more than half of my daily caloric intake!	80
355	I missed my lecture while waiting in line for a Beaver Tail. But it was so worth it.	80
356	$4 for a Beaver Tail? What a rip off! Beaver Tails are overrated.	80
357	Beaver Tail stand? I must have missed it because I was so stressed about schoolwork.	80
358	Green. Irish. Need I say more?	81
359	It was so much fun, but I'm still recovering from excessive partying.	81
360	I was busy doing schoolwork.	81
361	St. Patrick's Day is overrated.	81
362	What is St. Patrick's Day?	81
363	Woo!	82
364	It's fun as long as there's no fork flying into my face.	82
365	I wouldn't do it, but I can see why it would be fun.	82
366	Those who participate should be held accountable.	82
367	You're all Animals!	82
368	Yellow: Life's good and I'm looking forward to summer!!	83
369	Green: I feel relaxed and at ease.	83
370	Blue: Once school finishes I will have nothing to do and no one to talk to. Sniff. Sniff.	83
371	Purple: The end of the year is bittersweet. I'm glad to be almost done, but I'm still not thrilled about summer.	83
372	Red: I am stressed, anxious and nervous about final exams.	83
385	I have connections.	86
384	I started searching early in the year.	86
383	I knocked on doors with my resume.	86
378	I had a fantastic time! 	85
379	It was surprisingly enjoyable. 	85
380	Disappointing, but avoiding Aberdeen is worth the price.	85
381	It's tragic. 	85
382	Homecoming? What Homecoming?	85
386	I searched for awhile, then settled for anything I could get.	86
387	I am unemployed.	86
388	I'm going to be a brand new person. This is the year I make my parents proud.	87
389	I think I'm doing just fine the way I am.	87
390	Work hard, play hard. It's all about balance. 	87
391	My goal is to eat one healthy meal a week and make it to half of my 8:30 classes.	87
392	Struggling is part of university life. Why change? 	87
393	I am very disappointed. I don't know what I can trust. 	88
394	Disappointed, but I'll be mailing my old bottle for the new one.	88
395	I'm looking for alternatives to SIGG. 	88
396	Chemicals are everywhere and we can't be concern with every little problem. 	88
397	I still use the plastic bottles.	88
398	It's cutting edge!	89
399	It's the direction we're headed, so there's no harm in trying.	89
400	It should only be used when it's absolutely relevant.	89
401	It's distracting.	89
409	I try my best to follow the safety procedures, but doubtful as to how much it'll help. 	91
408	I am worried and have started to act more cautiously. 	91
407	Hand sanitizers are my new best friend.	91
410	For me it's life as usual.	91
411	Yes! You can't stop the party.	92
412	I'll drop by to see what's happening.	92
413	I'll pass, I'm not interested	92
414	No, and neither should you, if you care about the school! 	92
415	Yes, it would definitely help with getting stress under control.	93
416	It's nice to get a break, but I would end up getting nothing done.	93
417	No, it's unnecessary 	93
418	Aberdeen.	94
419	At home, partying with my friends.	94
420	At home, trying to study. 	94
421	I just slept through the night.	94
422	It's too soon and unnecessary.	95
423	I already have the campagin posters for my window ready to go up. 	95
424	Pointless or not, it's an important excercise of democratic rights.	95
425	Doesn't matter, I won't be voting anyways. 	95
426	No, it's the individual's fault for choosing to smoke.	96
427	Yes, companies should take responsibility.	96
428	I don't. 	97
429	It makes me feel better than drinking soda. 	97
430	For the vitamins!	97
431	He deserved it. 	98
432	I can't decide whether it was fair or not. It depends on who else was nominated.  	98
694	Egg nog	166
433	I hope it motivates him to meet the expectations.	98
434	It was too soon.	98
435	He didn't deserve it. 	98
436	Ready as always.	99
437	I'll make it through.	99
438	I should be studying right now instead of answering this poll. 	99
439	Thanks for reminiding me, I have to check when my exams are. 	99
440	I had my costume picked out months ago.	100
441	I'm looking forward to the parties. 	100
442	I'm going to stay home and eat a lot of candy. 	100
443	Halloween is for little kids.	100
444	It's necessary to make the road safer. 	101
445	People will just find other ways to use cellphones.	101
446	Completely banning it is too strict.	101
447	OMGYG2BK!	101
448	No one.	102
449	One person.	102
450	Just a few people. 	102

462	I have sooo much reading I need to catch up on. 	105
463	I'm thinking I should probably start going to lectures. 	105
464	I am doing quite well on my readings and my assignments. 	105
465	I am sad that it's over soon. I love my classes. 	105
466	I don't keep secrets, I like having nothing to hide. 	106
467	I only share secrets with my close friends. 	106
468	I have secrets I have kept for years without telling a single soul. 	106
469	I'm sending my secrets to Postscript!	106

471	Looking forward to some quality time with my family. 	107
472	I'm taking a trip to someplace warm. 	107
473	I'll probably sleep for weeks to recover from the exams.	107

7778	Travel treasures	Downtown store gets merchandise from annual global trips 	travel-treasures	3	325	\N	Modern Primitive isn’t just another shop sprawled across the stretch of Princess St. — it’s a place that traces the travels of its storeowners.\r\n\r\nThe store has an array of jewellery and clothing for shoppers to browse, straying away from mass-produced items and opting for unique pieces from across the globe.\r\n\r\nDavid Parkinson co-owns the store with his wife Bonnie. He’s been in the jewellery buying and selling business for over 20 years and he said Modern Primitive started with an encounter in Spain.\r\n\r\n“I met a guy from Argentina. We used to work on the same markets in Pamplona during big events like the running of the bulls,” Parkinson said. “The guy said to me: ‘I’ll give you the key to life if you want to travel’.” \r\n\r\nParkinson met his wife while in Spain and they began to sell jewellery together.\r\n\r\nAfter the couple traveled around for a few years in Europe, Parkinson said he and his wife decided to move to Canada because she was anxious to come back home.\r\n\r\nThe couple first opened a shop at 120 Princess St., later moving to their current location at 72 Princess St.\r\n\r\nWhen the shop first opened, most of their jewellery was from Mexico.\r\n\r\n“There’s a huge market for jewellery in Mexico. It’s very popular there,” he said.\r\n\r\nAt first they only sold jewellery in the store, but later decided to expand into the back area and bring in apparel.\r\n\r\n“It was a normal progression,” Parkinson said.\r\n\r\nMarkets in Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal and India are just a few of the places that Parkinson has traveled through to buy products to sell at the store.\r\n\r\n“When I go there, I go to the market first to see what’s going on. Markets aren’t like what they are here — markets are huge and they have a whole section of artisans,” he said.\r\n\r\nIn order to decide what items to purchase, Parkinson said he simply takes a look around.\r\n\r\n“I look at what the tourist girls are wearing because those are the kinds of things girls here would wear.”\r\n\r\nParkinson added that even if there is a language barrier when he travels, everyone understands the language of buying and selling.\r\n\r\n“People get the idea if I want to buy something from them,” he said.\r\n\r\nOn average, trips last a couple of months and items are shipped to Canada after they are chosen.\r\n\r\nParkinson said half of the money is given immediately to pay for production costs while the shipper gets the rest of the money to give  to the merchants and artisans upon delivery of the finished items.\r\n\r\n He added that the most popular items in the store often vary.\r\n\r\n“Some years you may get a hot item of jewellery that everybody wants, like feather earrings for example, and it’s always changing,” he said.\r\n\r\nParkinson said they are planning to expand Modern Primitive with a location opening in Westport, a town one hour north of Kingston.

7766	Underwood to suit up for Canada	Former Gaels rugby coach leads charge in bid to bring international test match to Kingston	underwood-suit-canada	7	325	\N	Queen’s is set to host a major international rugby competition next month. Team Canada and Team U.S.A. will face off in a men’s rugby test match at Richardson Stadium on June 9.\r\n\r\nGaels veteran Liam Underwood will dress for Team Canada. It’s an honour he’s earned after a steady progression up Canada’s rugby ladder.\r\n\r\n“The Coach has seen me play from past tournaments, so we’re familiar,” Underwood said.\r\n\r\nPart of Canada’s under-20 team in 2010 and 2011, Underwood’s jump to the senior roster partly came out of the blue. The opportunity arose after Team Canada’s Connor Braid sustained an injury while playing for his club in B.C. Underwood plays the same two positions as Braid — fly half and fullback.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t really see it coming,” Underwood said, adding that he’s never played in front of thousands of fans before, despite previous international rugby experience.\r\n\r\nHead coach of the Gaels men’s rugby team Peter Huigenbos is also video analyst for the Canadian men’s team.\r\n\r\n“It’s a pleasure to work with Liam,” Huigenbos said. “I’ll actually be spending much more time with Liam; it’s a 24/7 commitment, and he’s ready for it.”\r\n\r\nHuigenbos has coached Underwood since 2010, the year the Gaels won the OUA championship.\r\n\r\n“He was 18 years old, setting up three of our four tries to win the OUA,” Huigenbos said. “He’s a quiet leader ... who understands the game on another level.”\r\n\r\nThe game at Richardson Stadium is a ten-minute walk from where Underwood plays each fall in a Queen’s uniform. Huigenbos said the local organizational committee deserves much credit.\r\n\r\n“The community’s support for this game has been phenomenal.” he said.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, there will be more than just national pride at stake. Canada is ranked 13th in the world, while the U.S.A. is ranked 17th. Only the top 12 teams from the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand are automatic qualifiers for 2015. Huigenbos said these test matches affect those international rankings.\r\n\r\n“For [World Cup] 2015, unfortunately we still need to qualify. Despite beating Tonga [in New Zealand], they still finished ahead of us in our pool, claiming automatic qualification for the next world cup.”\r\n\r\nOne of Kingston’s most decorated rugby figures helped make the game happen.\r\n\r\nJohn Phelan, an associate professor at Queen’s School of Business, is a former captain of Canada’s national rugby team. He’s also chair of the 15-person Local Organizing Committee that capitalized on a bid to bring the test match to Kingston. Consisting mainly of local business people, it was the same committee that brought the Barclay’s Churchill Cup pool games to Kingston in 2008.\r\n\r\n“Teams have always liked playing here,” Phelan said. “We did a good job in 2008 hosting Canada, Ireland, Scotland, England, U.S.A. and Argentina, and if we do it well this time, they’ll come back again.”\r\n\r\nWhile Rugby Canada continues to use Richardson as a venue for international rugby competitions, the sport is also thriving in Kingston. Phelan said rugby is evolving more into the forefront of Kingston sports culture.\r\n\r\n“KEDCO and Kingston tourism are some of the businesses behind us,” he said. “And Kingston truly is a rugby community.”\r\n\r\nPhelan works with the Kingston Panthers rugby organization at the youth levels creating introductory programs for children as young as six years old.\r\n\r\n“One of my older mentors once told me ‘you owe the game,’ and I agree because it’s given me that much in my life.”\r\n\r\n“For [World Cup] 2015, unfortunately we still need to qualify. Despite beating Tonga [in New Zealand], they still finished ahead of us in our pool, claiming automatic qualification for the next world cup.”\r\n	Queen’s is set to host a major international rugby competition next month.

7773	Men have right to safe space		right-safe-space	13	325	\N	The allocation of $30,000 of student funding to the creation of a men’s centre at Simon Fraser University has been finalized after the University’s Student Society Treasurer proposed the initiative.\r\n\r\nControversy has surrounded the opening of the centre, with doubts  raised about the intentions behind its creation and what purpose it may serve.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the idea of a men’s centre isn’t negative, so long as it’s implemented in a careful, well-thought out and sensitive fashion. Specifically, much concern has been raised about the potential that a men’s centre could simply turn into a frat house — a place for men to make misogynistic jokes, play video games and watch sports.\r\n\r\nIt’s ultimately unfair to assume that this will happen — it creates negative stereotypes that deny the use  a men’s centre could have on a university campus.\r\n\r\nMen, just as women, face countless gendered societal pressures. Much of machismo culture denies men the safe space to discuss their vulnerabilities and personal issues with one another. This has led to much higher suicide and alcoholism rates among men compared to women. Homosexual or transsexual men face societal stigmas on top of this.\r\n\r\nA men’s centre can be used to create a safe space for men to discuss their problems, helping to fight the stigmas that they encounter on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nBut, in order for such an environment to be created, a significant amount of oversight must be implemented by the students and university members involved in the centre’s creation.\r\n\r\nA clear mandate must be outlined for the centre, with an appropriate level of funding allocated – $30,000, which is the amount currently recommended, seems excessive for the proposed purposes of the centre.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, students and administrators must hold the centre to account, ensuring that it’s used as a safe space to discuss issues that men face. Otherwise it risks morphing into a boys’ club that only furthers patriarchal values and negative stereotypes.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a men’s centre shouldn’t stifle the prevalence or importance of women’s issues, or issues facing other marginalized groups on campus. A dialogue about gender issues facilitated through the men’s centre would add a positive element to its creation.\r\n\r\nFor equality’s sake, men, just as women, should have a safe space allocated to them to discuss and cope with the societal stigmas that they may face.\r\n\r\nIf the men’s centre at Simon Fraser University can establish an environment that fits the above criteria, its creation and funding will be justifiable.\r\n\r\n<em>— Journal Editorial Board  </em>	The allocation of $30,000 of student funding to the creation of a men’s centre at Simon Fraser University has been finalized after the University’s Student Society Treasurer proposed the initiative.	\N	t	f	Gender, Simon Fraser University 	f	2012-05-28 16:29:38-04	p	f	f
7751	News in brief		news-brief	1	\N	\N	<strong>Federal budget continues investment into research, while cutting youth program </strong>\r\n\r\nThe federal budget released on March 29 looks to invest in research at universities, but also cuts beneficial youth programs.\r\n\r\nSteven Liss, vice-principal of research, said the federal budget makes a strong statement about the government’s confidence in universities.\r\n\r\n“There is certainly a strong statement on the prominence of basic foundational research and international world-class research, but at the same time the role that universities play in supporting innovation through partnerships,” Liss said.\r\n\r\nThe $37 million in annual investments outlined in the federal budget will help to continue Queen’s research reputation.\r\n\r\n“We continue to do well and to focus our strengths and the diverse range of research in all areas including health, social sciences, humanities, the arts, sciences and engineering,” Liss said.\r\n\r\nCuts to youth programs were also included in the budget.\r\n\r\nKatimavik – a youth volunteer service program started in 1977 and funded by the Canadian government – has been stopped immediately, meaning the 2012-13 program which was supposed to begin in September is cancelled.\r\n\r\n“Without a program like this, youth won’t get exposed to critical thinking and given the hands-on experience and common sense learning that goes together with the knowledge that we learn in the classroom,” former participant Alyssa Chin, ArtSci ’12, said.\r\n\r\nOther cuts in the budget include an end to the penny, which is projected to save the government $11 million per year, and the laying off of 12,000 government employees over three years.\r\n\r\n<em>- Rosie Hales </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>House fire in Student Ghetto </strong>\r\n\r\nA Kingston Police report released on April 1 indicated that a house near Division and Earl Streets was set on fire around 2 a.m. on Saturday, March 3. Ted Posedowski, the fire inspector assigned to the case, said the fire was “suspicious.”\r\n\r\nThe five tenants of the 72 Division St. home said they were told by Posedowski that the fire started in the front door's mail-box slit. The fire damaged the front area of the house and caused smoke to rise to the second floor.  Posedowski said he couldn’t confirm whether the fire was caused by arson.\r\n\r\nNone of the residents were home when the fire started. However, a cat was left in a second-floor bedroom and had to receive medical attention.\r\n\r\n“Almost everything in our rooms was covered in soot,” Cindy Kwong, ArtSci ’14, said. “Our staircase leads to the front door where the fire started. If we were home we wouldn’t have been able to get out.”\r\n\r\nThe tenants weren’t allowed to re-enter their home until renovations were completed in late March. The tenants say they plan to take their landlord, Wayne Gollogly, to small-claims court over emotional damages. \r\n\r\n“We literally spent over $1,500 in hotel fees, moving all of our stuff, and replacing all our food,” Kwong said.\r\n\r\nGollogly could not be reached for comment following the fire. \r\n\r\nThe fire is currently under investigation by Kingston Police.\r\n\r\nKingston Police is urging those who witnessed or have knowledge of the event to come forward and contact the department at 613-549-4660.\r\n\r\n <em>- Vincent Matak (with files from Clare Clancy)</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Alumnus establishes endowment</strong>\r\n\r\nAn Engineering alumnus has established The Hazell Endowment in Chemical Design and Innovation, a fund that will go towards innovation and chemical design.\r\n\r\nEvan Hazell, Sci ’81, is a petroleum engineer and an investment banker. Through his endowment fund, he wants to see a melding of the science and business worlds.\r\n\r\nDean of Engineering and Applied Science Kimberly Woodhouse said this donation will put graduates ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\nThe funding will go towards a research professorship as well new innovation programming.  \r\n\r\n<em>- Sean Renaud</em> \r\n\r\n<strong>New Masters program planned</strong>\r\n\r\nQueen’s has added a new graduate program to its course offerings for September.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a Master of Science in Health-care Quality, Risk and Safety program was passed at the March 27 Senate meeting.\r\n\r\nDr. Jennifer Medves, vice-dean of the School of Nursing said the program is fairly unique.\r\n\r\n“We want really good quality health care and we need to revolutionize how we give care and this is the kind of program that we hope is going to get the minds to be thinking together about how they can do things differently,” Medves said.\r\n\r\nThe program is run through the School of Nursing and the department of anesthesiology.\r\n\r\nThis two-year graduate program is mostly completed online with the exception of one week on Queen’s campus in September and one week in January.\r\n\r\n“The real appeal for it is that this is a program that is interdisciplinary, inter-professional so students will learn from and will teach others about their own discipline or profession and they’ll learn others’ disciplines and professions and they really will be looking and reading and writing about a topic that is dear to all of our hearts,” Medves said.\r\n\r\nThe degree proposal was passed with a majority vote in Senate. Senators had five days to look over the proposal document. \r\n\r\n<em> - Rachel Herscovici</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Student to bike 8,000 kilometers</strong>\r\n \r\nOn May 15, Ira Carson will fly to British Columbia with his brother and a friend to begin an 8,000-kilometre bike ride from Victoria to St. John's, N.L. in an effort to raise money for the Easter Seals Camp in Merrywood.\r\n\r\n"The actual distance isn't 8,000 kilometres, but we plan on cycling 8,000 kilometres because we want to stop and visit lots of small cool places but we're also going to get lost along the way," Carson, ArtSci' 12, said. \r\n\r\n8,000 kilometres for Easter Seals aims to cover the distance in 13 weeks and raise $8,000, a dollar for each kilometre travelled. All proceeds will be donated to the camp, in particular the accessible sailing program which uses specially-modified sailing boats for those otherwise unable to sail.\r\n\r\n<em>- Asad Chishti </em>	Updates on the Queen's community.	\N	t	f	News in brief	f	2012-04-13 14:46:28-04	p	t	t
7750	Law student wins Tricolour award	Erin Smith recognized for her contributions to equity on campus	law-student-solo-winner-tricolour-award	1	\N	\N	For the second time in its history, the Agnes Benidickson Tricolour Award has been given to one student.\r\n\r\nErin Smith, JD and MBA '12, will receive the award in a ceremony this spring.\r\n\r\nThe award is given annually to students who have made a significant contribution to the community in a non-athletic and non-academic way.\r\n\r\nThe first stand-alone winner of the Tricolour Award was Michele Romanow, Sci ’07, who founded the Tea Room in her second year and received the award in her final year of study.\r\n\r\nThe award usually recognizes several students but this year the selection committee unanimously chose Smith because of her profound impact on equity at Queen’s.\r\n\r\n “We were not under the impression that we had to give out a certain number of awards.  The bar is set really high for the award and she is the only one who reached that bar,” Rector Nick Francis said.\r\n\r\n“She put in foundations that the [selection] committee felt would extend past her time at Queen’s.  Her work will benefit all students in the long run, it’s not just the law school,” Francis said.\r\n\r\nThe Rector chairs the selection committee, which consists of 16 student representatives from all faculty societies. Smith’s passion for equity issues led her to spearhead various campaigns that affect students across all faculties.\r\n\r\nShe said her most prominent contribution to equity at Queen’s is with her work under the Equity Committee under the Law Student’s Society. Smith is currently the third-year co-commissioner of the committee.\r\n\r\nIn this role, Smith has implemented Positive Space training and office hours, the Campus and Community Fair, the Equity Survey and the Sober Socializing Initiative.\r\n\r\n“The Sober Socializing Initiative started this year and was the idea of my co-commissioner.  It’s for people who want to hold events that aren't alcohol-focused,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe Equity Committee has teamed up with various groups on campus for this initiative, including the Human Rights Club to help with the logistics, promotion, and funding of events that do not revolve around alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide better service and respond better to the needs of the Queen’s law students, Smith created the Equity Survey, which will gauge what the main issues in the law school are and how students would like to improve them.  \r\n\r\nAfter completing her undergraduate degree at McGill University, Smith noticed a difference in campus culture upon arriving at Queen’s University for law school.\r\n\r\n“I was struck by the less-open culture here than I found at McGill and surprised by, perhaps, the conservatism and attitudes that were present at Queen’s, particularly in the law school,” Smith said.\r\n\r\n “It’s no secret that Queen’s has had some equity-related problems,” Smith said.\r\n\r\nSmith said she took initiative to try and change things.\r\n\r\n“Everyone should be comfortable being who they are and shouldn’t be afraid to be who they.  We should try to create an environment where that is true.”\r\n\r\nOriginally established as the Tricolour Award in 1939, the award was later renamed the Agnes Benidickson Tricolour Award after Dr. Agnes Benidickson, the first female chancellor of Queen’s University from 1980 to 1996.\r\n\r\n	For the second time in its history, the Agnes Benidickson Tricolour Award is given to only one student.	\N	t	f	Student life, Tricolour award	f	2012-04-13 14:44:09-04	p	t	t
7775	Student strikes raise concerns 	Rising tuition costs across the country need to be evaluated to ensure quality education	student-strikes-raise-concerns	4	325	\N	For over 100 days, students in Quebec have been marching, chanting and boycotting classes in protest of a $1,625 tuition increase spread over five years.\r\n\r\nStudent protesters have led peaceful demonstrations with thought-provoking and clearly-articulated talking points; they’ve also rioted, broken windows and tossed smoke bombs into subway systems.\r\n\r\nNational and international media have been recycling and recreating exciting names for the movement. From the Toronto Star it is the ‘Student Uprising’, at Maclean’s it is the ‘Maple Spring’.\r\n\r\nThere’s no question that post-secondary education for Quebec students is cheap — it’s one of the least expensive options in North America.\r\n\r\nToday, Quebec’s average undergraduate tuition is $2,519 per year, in comparison Ontario’s average is $6,640.\r\n\r\nQuebec’s perspective on tuition cannot be isolated from its social and historical roots.  The unique socio-economic position of Quebec requires a nuanced understanding of a culture with a long standing, powerful youth and union movement as well as a philosophical alignment with more socialist education policies of France, Germany and Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the largest student groups say that ideally, tuition in Quebec will reach the level promised during the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s — free.\r\n\r\nDespite cries of “Solidarity!”, student strikes remain incredibly divisive within their own communities. The discounted rates are not universal; only eligible to students born in Quebec or educated through their secondary school system receive lower tuition.\r\n\r\nAbout 30 per cent of Quebec students are striking; the rest have spent the past few months attending class, writing exams and strolling through campuses filled with pamphlets, protesters and riot police. The past few weeks have seen a transformation of the protests into a wider social movement, drawing upon longstanding social, political and economic concerns.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mean for us at Queen’s?\r\n\r\nThe reality is that tuition in Ontario has increased every year for the past five years and our tuition due on Sept. 1 will be increasing yet again. The Ontario government has extended the current tuition framework allowing schools to increase their tuition by an institutional maximum of five per cent. Some programs, such as Commerce, have increased by eight per cent.\r\n\r\nSince 2009, Ontario has held the dubious distinction of having the most expensive average tuition. Continually increasing tuition without developing metrics that guarantee quality is detrimental to the value of a post-secondary experience.\r\n\r\nThe governments of Ontario and Quebec argue that the current system is unsustainably expensive. New technology, new departments, new building projects, increased student support services, pension agreements and a booming number of students have led the costs associated with an undergraduate education to skyrocket in the past 30 years.\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind tuition increases remains that Ontario is currently experiencing concern over provincial debt.\r\n\r\nHowever, students remain highly sensitive to economic flux; unemployment among high-school students, post-secondary students and recent graduates remain incredibly high.\r\n\r\nThe governments can’t deny affordable access to all students in a world which increasingly requires the technical and intellectual sophistication of a post-secondary education.\r\n\r\nReasonable increases in tuition, as measured using inflation should be allowed to ensure quality, but the Ontario government must recognize that students are currently graduating with more debt and fewer employment prospects than our predecessors.\r\n\r\nBoth the government and broader society reap the rewards of our post-secondary learning; Ontarians with degrees are more likely to live longer, be healthier, commit fewer crimes, vote in larger numbers, volunteer in their community and donate to charity.\r\n\r\nThere is a financial imperative to investing in post-secondary education, according to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce ‘the 27 per cent of Ontarians with post-secondary education credentials contribute 50 per cent of the income tax.’\r\n\r\nA cost-sharing model, one which equitably divides the contributions of the government and students can deliver affordable, quality education.\r\n\r\nThe AMS currently advocates a 70 per cent government, 30 per cent student split based on the average contributions of governments across Canada.  Presently, the Ontario split is 55 per cent government, 45 per cent student.\r\n\r\nGiant placards announcing “Hey! The complicated mélange of global financial concerns, conflicting institutional perspectives and stagnant funding formulas have led my University and Government to increasingly look at my fourth-year history tuition as a revenue generator!” aren’t nearly as eye-catching as strike tactics.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, good politics and solid policy rarely grab as much attention.\r\n\r\nThe Quebec student strikes have highlighted important concerns about accessibility, affordability, and cost-sharing, situations relatable to Ontario students burdened by unfairly shifting costs.  Instead of dialogue equating the importance of a university education with its ultimate financial consequences, we also need to tailor our discussions on quality within the undergraduate context.\r\n\r\nThese concerns are not limited to students. Faculty and administration are hypersensitive to the changing field and nature of post-secondary education, but universities in Quebec have been quiet on the ongoing strike.\r\n\r\nDiscussions on tuition must include an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders: government, universities and students.\r\n\r\nI was born in Quebec City. If I had chosen to attend any university in Quebec, it’s possible that I would be paying less than half of my Queen’s tuition. The legacy of your Queen’s education cannot be simplified into a bottom line.  \r\n\r\nThe Quebec student strike has done a tremendous job of casting major attention on the financial cost of a Quebec education, but the pivotal issue that remains is how to measure exactly how much tuition we should be paying, and how we calculate if it’s worth the cost.\r\n\r\n<strong>Isabelle Duchaine is the AMS Academic Affairs Commissioner</strong>	The Quebec student strikes have highlighted important concerns about accessibility, affordability, and cost-sharing, situations relatable to Ontario students burdened by unfairly shifting costs.	\N	t	t	Tuition, student protests 	t	2012-05-28 16:35:09-04	p	f	f
7776	Creating a spectacle 	From billboards to tents, Art in Public Places Kingston includes six installations located around town 	creating-spectacle	3	325	\N	I’ve walked past Bagot and Queen St. dozens of times in my four years at Queen’s, but when I saw a radically green living room set up, I had to do a double take.\r\n\r\nFor me the encounter wasn’t accidental.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the day I’d climbed aboard a school bus packed with artists and art lovers for the opening tour of a six piece curated art project titled <em>Art in Public Places Kingston.</em>\r\n\r\nThe public exhibits are part of a show put on by xcurated Cultural Collective, created to stimulate discussion about art by situating it in public places. The theme, appropriately titled ‘Spectacle’, presented a dual question to audiences — is public art a spectacle in itself or does it only depict the spectacle already inherent in society?\r\n\r\nWe first stopped by Catherine Toews’ billboard piece on Taylor Kidd Blvd. which showed three fashion magazine inspired images of women looking vulnerable and exposed.\r\n\r\nWe then arrived at Lemoine Point Conservation Area to view what appeared to be a simple red tent in the middle of a field.  As we headed down the trail, we were told that the tent was actually Robert Hengeveld’s <em>Into the Wild</em>.\r\n\r\nNo longer just a piece of camping gear, the interior had been spread with camouflage nylon and small pieces hung down like drying meat at a butcher’s shop.\r\n\r\nThe hung nylon alluded to an unsettling reality. Surrounded by the otherwise tranquil and natural lake, it was as if something dark was hiding in the shadows of the installation.  \r\n\r\nAs the bus veered back downtown, Michael Davidge’s <em>Pretty Vacancy </em>appeared from the bus window — a neon-lit sign which was a literal representation of the Sex Pistol’s 1977 hit “Pretty Vacant” melding with the stylistic design of a motel’s vacancy sign. The mundane and lazy manifestation of a curious phrase makes this one stop that can be avoided.\r\n\r\nLuckily, those without a car can view the best and most outlandish pieces of the collection within walking distance from campus. Inside a pit that will eventually be filled with condos lies <em>Greenroom</em>, a living room set partially cast out of hollow fibreglass.\r\n\r\nMillie Chen and Warren Quigley’s piece was created to be a socially conscious satire on the corporate greening trend. The brown walls of the pit provided a contrasting landscape for the hues of green the work utilizes. It’s proven its purpose by already making passersby stop and stare at the brilliantly thought-out juxtaposition between interior and exterior.\r\n\r\nSteven Laurie’s <em>Donut Machine </em>inside the Cataraqui Centre is also included in the collection but was not part of the tour.\r\n\r\nThe final stop of the tour took us to the tree in front of the Pump House Steam Museum to see Shayne Dark’s <em>Free Form in Blue</em>, a vibrant stack of cedar split rails covered in deep blue paint and nestled amongst the tree’s branches.\r\n\r\nDark’s installation was the most simplistic of the project, but also the most overt example of the theme of spectacles — enabling viewers to stop and question what public art means.\r\n\r\n<strong>Art in Public Places Kingston runs until June 8.\r\n\r\nA roundtable discussing the importance of public art will be held on June 7 at 7 p.m. in Market Square.</strong>\r\n	Art in Public Places Kingston presents a dual question to audiences — is public art a spectacle in itself or does it only depict the spectacle already inherent in society?\r\n	\N	t	f	Art review, Art in Public Places	f	2012-05-28 16:47:09-04	p	f	f
7752	Leaving the wild	Wildlife lead singer recalls his musical days at Queen's	leaving-wild	3	\N	\N	Wildlife lead singer Dean Povinsky has moved on from his days of playing in grungy basements of the Queen’s Student Ghetto.\r\n\r\n“The ceilings weren’t tall enough and there was half a flood in the corner,” Povinsky, BFA’05, said. “It was places where human beings weren’t supposed to be.” After graduating from Queen’s, Povinsky and friend Darryl Smith moved to Glasgow where they formed Wildlife with Scottish drummer Peter Kelly and fellow Canadian Billy Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe group eventually decided to leave Glasgow and return to the more passionate fans in Toronto in 2006.\r\n\r\n“People are generally more enthusiastic about everything in Canada than in the U.K.,” he said. “The main difference for me was on a visceral level. [In Glasgow] it’s rainier and gets dark earlier and it can be sort of depressing.”\r\n\r\nIn 2006 Wildlife underwent a massive line-up change to include guitarist Graham Plant, drummer Dwayne Christie, bassist Derek Bosomworth and synthesizer Julia Mensink. In 2009 Tim Daugulis replaced Mensink who left the band because she and Povinsky had broken up.\r\n\r\n“We were boyfriend and girlfriend,” Povinsky said, “There was a few reasons why she left, it wasn’t creative differences.\r\n\r\n“It was less to do with the actual band.”\r\n\r\nThe Toronto-based group is playing a show at the Mansion at the end of April and Povinsky said they couldn’t be happier to be returning to Kingston after playing a show here last October.\r\n\r\n“I always like going back to Kingston,” he said. “It’s basically my favourite city ever.\r\n\r\n“I used to stay during the summer instead of going home to Oshawa; it was so nice in the summertime.”\r\n\r\nWildlife’s sound has been compared to breakout Canadian group Arcade Fire. Povinsky said he doesn’t mind the comparison at all.\r\n\r\n“It was hard for me to understand but what I came to the conclusion of was our songs fill the same emotional space for people as Arcade Fire and Wolf Parade -- bands we’re huge fans of,” he said.\r\n\r\nPovinsky added that the comparisons could be worse.\r\n\r\n“If someone wants to call us a punkier Arcade Fire, by all means. It’s definitely a lot better than getting compared to Staind or Three Days Grace.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Wildlife plays the Mansion tonight at 9 p.m.</strong>\r\n\r\n	Interview with the band Wildlife.	\N	t	f	Interview, Wildlife, Kingston, Queen's University	f	2012-04-20 21:00:00-04	p	t	t
7780	Arts in brief		arts-brief	3	325	\N	<strong>Nude Stephen Harper portrait sold </strong>\r\n\r\nA nude portrait of Stephen Harper named ‘Emperor Haute Couture’ that is on display at the Kingston Public Library on Johnson St. was sold for $5,000 on May 24.  \r\n\r\nArtist Margaret Sutherland painted the piece for the Kingston Arts Council’s Juried Art Salon, an annual competition that’s judged by three professional artists.\r\n\r\nThe oil painting depicts the Prime Minister lying on a recliner in the buff with a dog at his feet. He’s also being served a Tim Horton’s coffee from a woman. The painting is meant to be a political satire of Harper’s cuts to arts programs in the country.\r\n\r\nSutherland’s body of work includes other nude portraits and more popularly, a demonic painting of Pope Benedict’s face.\r\n\r\nThe painting will be on display at the library until the end of the month.\r\n\r\n<em>— Savoula Stylianou</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Awesome Kingston funds film project</strong>\r\n\r\nAwesome Kingston has given a $1,000 grant to a Kingston film project that intends to make one movie a week for 26 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe venture is called 26 Shorts and will involve asking a group of Kingston filmmakers to shoot one movie every week using a Kingston cast, crew and location.\r\n\r\nEric Ferguson came up with the idea when he realized that local filmmakers spend more time sitting at the pub than out making movies.\r\n\r\n“A lot of pints get finished, but not a lot of films,” Ferguson, ConEd ’11, said.\r\n\r\nFerguson went to an Awesome Kingston meeting and had 90 seconds to pitch his idea to the panel of judges.\r\n\r\n“The idea is the antithesis of a normal grant procedure,” he said. “They gave me a paper bag filled with $1,000 cash and they don’t check in afterwards.”\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers are currently in the stages of scouting and planning the 26 short films that could range anywhere from one minute to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nFerguson said he’s planning to start the project in August and finish by early February next year. The project is aiming to screen some of the films at the Kingston Canadian Film Festival in March 2013.\r\n\r\n<em>— Savoula Stylianou</em>\r\n\r\n	Arts in brief	\N	t	f	Arts in brief	f	2012-05-28 17:08:16-04	p	f	f

7753	11 participate in Queen’s Kony 2012		11-participate-in-queens-kony-2012	1	\N	\N	Over 1,100 people were confirmed as attending the Queen’s Does Kony 2012 event on Facebook, but only 11 people showed up on Friday night.\r\n\r\nStarting at 10 p.m. the group put up over 100 posters along Princess Street. By 2 a.m. many of the posters had been taken down or destroyed and only remnants were left.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s event coincided with the worldwide Kony 2012 campaign’s Cover the Night event – an attempt to raise awareness of the group’s goal of capturing Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony.\r\n\r\nInvisible Children, the charity behind the Kony 2012 campaign to capture, offered activists around the world the opportunity to participate in the Cover the Night event by ordering an Action Kit containing posters, bracelets and other promotional material. \r\n\r\nWynne Baker, one of the Queen’s event organizers, said wasn’t expecting a high turnout to the event in light of criticism the charity has received since their YouTube video garnered over 100 million views last month.\r\n\r\nBaker and her friends tried to differentiate themselves from Invisible Children by making their own posters and changing the event name to “Queen’s Does Kony 2012” instead of  “Cover the Night”.\r\n\r\n“I personally do not support Invisible Children,” Baker, ArtSci ’15, said. “Personally I wouldn’t give money to them so I didn’t order [an action kit from Invisible Children].”\r\n\r\nKony’s rebel group, Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), is believed to have abducted more than 30,000 children and turned them into soldiers or sex slaves.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care about the politics. I don’t care about the budget. I don’t care about all that. What we are here for is to bring awareness to 30,000 children who don’t have a future. That’s all we care about.” Baker said. “You don’t have to support the cause to support the idea. If you want to hate, that’s great. That shows you don’t care about children.”\r\n\r\nBaker said the environmental impact of printing and putting up hundreds of posters could’ve been another a factor for the low turn out.\r\n\r\n“I think people will wake up tomorrow and get a nice shock seeing all the posters and hopefully they'll get on a computer and look up who Kony is,” Baker said.\r\n\r\nKingston Police said they haven’t received calls in regards to the Kony 2012 Cover the Night event. However, it is a city bylaw violation to post on hydro poles and city properties.\r\n\r\n“KONY” was taped on the windows of Urban Outfitters on Princess Street, but by 2 a.m. only the letter “O” could be seen at the time.\r\n\r\nChris Le Feuvre, manager of Urban Outfitters on Princess St. said they didn’t notice anything when the store opened.

7754	Radio station's separation finalized 	Memorandum of Understanding signed by AMS and license holder	radio-stations-separation-finalized	1	\N	\N	Queen’s campus radio station, CFRC is looking to raise its student fee after beginning its gradual separation from the AMS yesterday.\r\n\r\nIf the $4.93 AMS student fee doesn’t increase the station will go bankrupt, CFRC Operations Officer Kristiana Clemens said.\r\n\r\n“The only reason the station has existed this long is because the AMS has subsidized the deficit and made up for the shortfalls in that deficit,” Clemens said.\r\n\r\nShe added that she expected the AMS to provide more financial support during its two-year transition from an AMS media service to a financially autonomous organization.  By May 2014, the service will no longer be under AMS control.\r\n\r\nA Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between CFRC and the AMS was passed on April 25 by members of the station’s license holder, Radio Queen’s University (RQU).\r\n\r\nThe MOU, which outlines the station’s transition, passed unanimously with three abstentions.\r\n\r\nCFRC is budgeted to incur a $10,000 deficit this year, covered by the AMS.\r\n\r\nUnder the MOU, the AMS will provide CFRC with a $10,000 grant in 2013-14 and a $5,000 grant the following year. These grants are meant to help stabilize the station’s deficit.\r\n\r\nClemens said these grants are less than the station received in previous transition periods.\r\n\r\nThe MOU states that a 2006 transfer agreement gave operational management of CFRC to the AMS from Queen’s.\r\n\r\n“The University paid the AMS an estimated $94,000 in grants during the transition,” Clemens said. “What the AMS is offering in terms of transition support will only be adequate if we increase our student fee.”\r\n\r\nAs a result of the MOU, CFRC will no longer receive the mandatory AMS student fee in 2013. Instead, the fee which brings in 40 per cent of the station’s revenue will be subject to triennial review.  \r\n\r\n“We’ve already maximized all other sources of revenue for the station,” Clemens said. “Without that extra money we hope to get by increasing our student fee, the station won’t be able to continue to function.”\r\n\r\nDiscussions for an MOU began in late March after the AMS Board of Directors proposed a management restructure for the station in October. The proposed plan was later found to be in violation of a Canadian Radio-television Communication (CRTC) legislation that required all campus community radio stations to be financially and managerially autonomous.\r\n\r\nDan Szczepanek, the 2011-12 AMS media services director, said the AMS plans to provide less grant money to the station than it was provided in 2003 due to its improved financial state.\r\n\r\n“Right now, the service brings in about $75,000 a year compared to an average of $25,000 in 2003,” Szczepanek, ArtSci ’11 said. “The MOU is to ensure that the AMS isn’t leaving the station out in the cold during its transition.”\r\n	Queen’s campus radio station, CFRC is looking to raise its student fee after beginning its gradual separation from the AMS yesterday.	\N	t	f	CFRC, AMS, CRTC	f	2012-05-02 21:40:35-04	p	t	t
7756	Majority of Council vote in favour of 2013 fall Homecoming	Principal Woolf says restoration is contingent on students' behaviour this fall	majority-council-vote-favour-2013-fall-homecoming	1	\N	\N	Queen’s is one step closer to having a fall Homecoming after a motion recommending the event be restored passed at University Council on Saturday.\r\n\r\nApproximately 130 Council members voted in favour of the motion to re-establish the event in 2013. Three opposed and seven abstained.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the motion passing, Principal Daniel Woolf said a comprehensive plan will be undertaken to look at bringing the celebration back to campus for 2013. Rebranding the event might be necessary, he added.\r\n\r\n“It may or may not be called Homecoming,” he said. “It’s very clear that students and alumni want a fall reunion back of some sort. We’ve already had the rector consulting with the AMS and I’ll take his advice with regards to student consultation.”\r\n\r\nOn May 2, the University announced Woolf’s intention to create a dialogue between student leaders, city representatives and other members of the Queen’s community about remodeling alumni reunions.\r\n\r\nDespite the motion passing at University Council, Woolf said the decision to bring Homecoming back ultimately depends on students’ behaviour this upcoming fall.\r\n\r\n“We want to avoid the reputation of trouble that we had in 2005 and 2008,” he said.\r\n\r\nDuring <a href="http://queensjournal.ca/story/2005-09-27/news/not-tradition/">Homecoming 2005</a>, over 5,000 partygoers were reported on Aberdeen Street, with a crowd later overturning a car and setting it on fire. By <a href="http://queensjournal.ca/story/2008-09-30/news/university-city-fall-short-homecoming-goals/">2008</a>, crowds of Homecoming revelers had spilled out of Aberdeen and into the neighbouring streets of Victoria, Johnson and University Avenue.\r\n\r\n“Obviously the thing that worries everyone is that sooner or later the unsafe circumstances of Aberdeen street parties will lead to a fatality,” Woolf said.\r\n\r\nDespite this, he said he realizes how important bringing back Homecoming a year early is for increasing alumni networking and support.\r\n\r\n“Let’s face it, alumni want to talk to current students and go to football games − so having a celebration in the fall, near the beginning of the year is very special.”\r\n\r\nThe motion was brought forth by councillors Michael McNair, ArtSci ’03, and Michael Kealy, Sci ’98 and Law '01.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Homecoming was suspended for two years. In fall 2010, Woolf announced that Homecoming would be suspended for an additional three years, until 2014.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the return of Homecoming at past University Council meetings, Woolf stated that the Aberdeen street party must subside before he’d consider bringing the event back.\r\n\r\nMcNair and former Rector Kealy said they thought Woolf's decision to extend the suspension of Homecoming negatively affected the Queen’s community and its alumni relations.\r\n\r\n“Every single year Queen’s doesn’t have a Homecoming, you lose a five, a 10, a 15-year [class] reunion,” Kealy said. “That is the reason why we as concerned councillors have brought this motion forth.”\r\n\r\n	Queen’s is one step closer to having a fall Homecoming after a motion recommending the event be restored passed at University Council on Saturday.\r\n	\N	t	f	Homecoming, University Council, Principal Woolf	f	2012-05-07 21:41:34-04	p	t	t
7755	Councillors want Homecoming back	A motion being brought to University Council tomorrow seeks to restore fall Homecoming by 2013	councillors-want-homecoming-back	1	\N	\N	Homecoming isn’t scheduled to return until 2014, but two University councillors want to bring it back sooner.\r\n\r\nMichael McNair, ArtSci ’03, and former Rector Michael Kealy, will present a motion to the University Council tomorrow to restore Homecoming by fall 2013.\r\n\r\nUniversity Council is one of three governing bodies of the University and the highest advisory body at Queen’s.\r\n\r\nIf the motion passes this weekend, University Council will recommend to Queen’s that they reinstate fall Homecoming by 2013. Queen’s must then inform the university community within six months of deciding to do so.  \r\n\r\nFall 2008 was the last time Homecoming was held. The two councillors have also created a Facebook group for supporters of their motion. At the time of this update, the group had over 3,200 members.\r\n\r\n“We have a new group of students who’ve never experienced Homecoming, so it’s a clean slate,” McNair said.“18 months is enough time to make it work ... the decision just keeps being deferred with no reason as to why it’s being deferred or what needs to be done to bring it back.”\r\n\r\nFollowing Homecoming 2008, the administration announced at a press conference that the event would be cancelled for at least two years because of safety concerns the Aberdeen street party raised.\r\n\r\nIn Nov. 2010, Principal Daniel Woolf declared that Homecoming would be suspended for another three years, with a projected return in 2014.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Woolf said the Aberdeen street party was still too much of a safety and security concern to think about reinstating Homecoming.\r\n\r\n“The numbers have gone down but they’re not, in my judgment, where they need to be in order to restore Homecoming,” Woolf  <a href="http://queensjournal.ca/story/2010-11-26/news/homecoming-hold/">told the <em>Journal</em></a> in Nov. 2010 “Were we to put Homecoming back now, I think the inevitable consequence would be the numbers would spike up again.”\r\n\r\nMichael Kealy said without a proper Homecoming, alumni are losing their connection to Queen’s. For them, Homecoming is more than just a party, he said.\r\n\r\nAs an alumnus sitting on University Council, Kealy said he’s asked about Homecoming constantly by other alumni.\r\n\r\n“I know [from] speaking with alumni that they felt that cancelation was too drastic,” Kealy, Sci ’98 and Law '01 said.\r\n\r\nKealy said he thinks the University Council meeting, which occurs every year in May, is the perfect platform for alumni to raise their concerns or questions about the University.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has brought up the question of when Homecoming will return at Council meetings in the past, he said the administration hasn’t been committed to bringing it back.\r\n\r\n“A commitment is what the motion is seeking — that there will be a plan to restore [Homecoming],” he said.  \r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Principal Woolf said in a Queen’s News Centre release that he understands that alumni value fall Homecoming.\r\n\r\n“I also know that the Queen’s community shares my concerns regarding the safety of our students, alumni, and City residents, and also concerns about the reputation of Queen’s and the City,” Woolf said in the release.\r\n\r\n<strong>See queensjournal.ca next week for an update on the motion to bring back Homecoming in 2013.</strong>	Homecoming isn’t scheduled to return until 2014, but two University councillors want to bring it back sooner.	\N	t	f	Homecoming, University Council 	f	2012-05-04 13:58:37-04	p	t	t
7757	A futuristic playground	Human Media Lab unveils new workspace in Jackson Hall	futuristic-playground	16	325	\N	Queen’s is now home to the first-ever ‘boutique’ laboratory, featuring innovations such as a videoconferencing pod and paper-thin phones.\r\n\r\nThe $1 million futuristic project was designed for Roel Vertegaal and his team of 12 to 14 computing and engineering graduate research students.   \r\n\r\nThe lab is hosted on the third floor of Jackson Hall and was unveiled to the public on May 12. Its use of visually stimulating patterns, shapes and colours combined with cutting-edge technology are meant to provide an interactive workspace for its students.\r\n\r\nThe Human Media Lab is one of several ubiquitous computing labs in Canada. Although they each possess different qualities, ubiquitous computing labs aim to integrate technology into everyday objects.\r\n\r\nVertegaal, director of the Human Media Lab and his team believe their technology will be viable in 10 to 20 years.  Goodwin Hall was the original home of the Human Media Lab, but despite its functional capacities it lacked inspiration, said Vertegaal.  \r\n\r\n“We don’t like to think of our technology as 'devices.' They should be as organic and natural as if it were integrated seamlessly into our lives,” he said.\r\n\r\nAfter securing the funding for the program from the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, Vertegaal and Queen’s School of Computing Director, Selim Akl, set out on planning and securing construction rights.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the three-year blueprint process, Vertegaal said partnering with award-winning designer Karim Rashid was the obvious choice.\r\n\r\nThe lab offers an open space available for group work as well as individual work areas. Students may opt to work privately in their own focus pod, each of which is divided by opaque glass.\r\n\r\nNoise-cancelling headsets remove visual and auditory distractions in the pod. When students wish to communicate with one another from adjoining pods, they can do so with ease.\r\n\r\n “We used geometric orientation and eye-tracking technology to recognize when students next door to each other are initiating contact. Then the glass panes respond by changing its opacity to become transparent,” Vertegaal said.  \r\n\r\nAlex Mihailidis, director of the Intelligent Assistive Technology and Systems Lab at the University of Toronto said their university lab uses a combination of conventional and non-conventional lab environments.\r\n\r\nTheir goal is to create flexible adaptive technology that enables users with disabilities to better carry out physical tasks.\r\n\r\n “We have the HomeLab, which is a fully functional house within our hospital so that we can easily configure different scenarios for testing,” he said.\r\n\r\nMihailidis said the attractiveness of the Human Media Lab sets it apart from similar technology labs in the country.\r\n\r\n“A space such as the Human Media Lab can definitely help to attract top students and trainees,” he said.\r\n\r\nHarry Smoak is the founding research coordinator and graduate student for the Topological Media Lab at Concordia University.\r\n\r\nHe said a more finished space wouldn’t work for his type of research because of their off-screen, hands-on approach.\r\n\r\n“Our space is quite different, more like a cross between a workshop and theatre space with the kind of raw infrastructure where we can hang equipment from the ceiling and drill through the floors,” he said.\r\n\r\nSmoak said the Topological Media Lab and the Human Media Lab both received funding from the Canada Foundation for Innovation.\r\n\r\n“Although [the Canada Foundation for Innovation’s] projects are consistently geared towards the infrastructure side of research, the outcome’s going to look different from project to project.”\r\n\r\nLab designer Karim Rashid created the workspace by incorporating visual fluidity with curvilinear shapes. In the lab, right angles are rare, while curvy, cantilevered conference tables and pod-shaped chairs are the norm.\r\n\r\n“It’s important for a space like this, where people are innovative, to take away those harsh angles and conventional rectangles you see virtually everywhere else,” Rashid said.\r\n\r\nFor Rashid, the shapes and lines he’s incorporated represent freedom.\r\n\r\nThe designer said he wanted to create a sense of wonder and excitement in the laboratory, inspired by the experiments conducted in the Human Media Lab.\r\n\r\nRashid said he wanted to create a space that would outlive short-term design trends.\r\n\r\n“I [tried] to make a space that will always be fresh, always be inspiring many years from now,” he said. “The key really, is to design with ideas like ‘freedom’ and ‘stimulation’ in mind, and not style.” \r\n\r\nDavid Holman, PhD ’12, is currently studying the use of Organic User Interfaces in the Human Media Lab.\r\n\r\n“The new lab is pretty exciting,” he said. “This is definitely a great development for the lab and students who might get to take advantage of it in the future.” \r\n\r\nHolman is still uncertain as to how likely the lab will be able to concretely promote creativity.\r\n\r\n“Creativity is such a difficult thing to grasp and it’s always brought out by a bunch of things working together, never just a single criteria. I think it’s going to be exciting to wait and tell.” 	Queen’s is now home to the first-ever ‘boutique’ laboratory, featuring innovations such as a videoconferencing pod and paper-thin phones.	\N	t	f	Technology, Human Media Lab, Roel Vertegaal	t	2012-05-28 12:52:32-04	p	f	f
7758	Campus Catchup		campus-catchup	1	325	\N	<strong>Computing students in BC reject mandatory gym class </strong>\r\n\r\nComputing students at the British Columbia Institute of Technology have started to rebel against mandatory gym classes they are required to attend. \r\n\r\nThe students are required to participate in one weekly 8:30 a.m. gym class in order to obtain their degree. \r\n\r\nThe mandatory gym classes have existed for several years, but students are only now beginning to voice their concerns with them.\r\n\r\nA petition has been signed by dozens of students and shows a wide opposition to these classes. A curriculum committee will decide on whether to keep the classes. \r\n\r\nComputing students are the only students on campus required to attend the 50-minute, uninstructed gym classes. According to an article in <em>Maclean’s</em>, many feel they are being unfairly picked on due to stereotypes that surround computing students. \r\n\r\nAssociate Dean of Computer Systems Technology, Brian Pidcock, insisted their intentions were good. \r\n\r\n“It’s not like we force them to play dodgeball. It’s not like high-school P.E,” he told <em>Maclean’s.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>— Rosie Hales</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Concordia to allow students to use chosen name</strong>\r\n\r\nAt Concordia University, transgender students will be able to use their chosen names on everything except their transcripts starting fall 2012.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of campaigning, students were granted the ability to make a written request to have only their chosen name on students IDs, class lists and exams, meaning that they don’t have to risk being called by a name they don’t identify with. \r\n\r\nThe University of Toronto has a similar policy.\r\n\r\nAt Queen’s, any requests to change a name must be accompanied by supporting documentation. \r\n\r\nBen Boudreau, a second-year student at Concordia, brought about this change after complaining about having to use his birth name. With help from Concordia’s 2110 Centre for Gender Advocacy, Boudreau staged a campaign which led to the University creating a working group to come up with the compromise.  \r\n\r\n<em>— Rosie Hales</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Study shows blended models are effective in universities</strong>\r\n\r\nA study by former Princeton University president William G. Bowen suggests blended learning may be more effective than traditional in-lecture learning.\r\n\r\nBlended learning is a combination of online and in-lecture learning.\r\n\r\nBowen’s study was conducted within six different public universities in the U.S. and involved 605 students. The students were placed in a statistics class that split them up in either a technology based or in-lecture class. The technology-based classes involved minimal lecture time.\r\n\r\nThe study concluded that students who took the technology based class performed just as well on the standardized tests as the other students and were able to learn the course material 25 per cent quicker.\r\n\r\nThe University of Manitoba recently implemented blended learning due to recent budget issues affecting the amount of available professors to teach introductory psychology courses.\r\n\r\nQueen’s has added blending learning to some of its classes in recent years, including PSYC 100.  \r\n\r\n<em>— Rachel Herscovici</em>\r\n\r\n	Catching up on what's making headlines at universities across Canada. 	\N	t	f	Campus Catchup	f	2012-05-28 13:01:56-04	p	f	f
7759	Work begins on arts centre	Concert hall scheduled to be completed by fall 2013	work-begins-arts-centre	1	325	\N	Construction has begun on the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts, which is set to open its first stage in fall of 2013.\r\n\r\n“It will open in stages,” Gordon Smith, associate dean of Arts and Science, said. Smith is the chair of the centre’s Operations and Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n“The concert hall will open first and we are hoping to have a series of concerts in the fall of 2013. The actual teaching in the facility will not happen until 2014,” he said.\r\n\r\nA dozen workers are currently working at the site to break the limestone ground so a crane can move in during the first week of June to start digging the foundations.\r\n\r\nThe construction team for the centre is confident that work will be finished on schedule. The rest of the centre will open in summer 2014.\r\n\r\n“It will be fantastic for Queen’s students. We’re going to have one of the best concert halls in eastern Canada for our music students, a black box theatre for drama students,” Smith said, adding that there will also be a film screening room.\r\n\r\n“The facilities are really state of the art,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe centre will be the new home of the Film and Media department faculty offices, as well as teaching spaces. The Music, Drama and Fine Arts departments will also use the centre for teaching and performances.\r\n\r\nSmith said the centre will definitely affect enrolment numbers for Arts programs at Queen’s, but there are currently no plans to increase enrolment in them.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the centre was supposed to begin in spring 2011, but the history and heritage of the site caused the two year delay.\r\n\r\n“The delay was a combination of things. This is a really complicated project because of the site. All of the heritage issues took a long time to work through,” Smith said.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, members of the City of Kingston’s heritage committee objected to plans to remove the windows and chimney on the Stella Buck Building, which were built in 1923.\r\n\r\nThe planning team ultimately decided to maintain the windows but not the chimney.\r\n\r\nThe Stella Buck building will be incorporated into the centre, forming the west side of the centre and including backstage areas and a film production studio.\r\n\r\nMembers of city council also objected to the shiny metallic siding the planning team originally planned to use, which they said would be a potential distraction to passing motorists. They have since chosen a less shiny siding.\r\n\r\n“It was a mutually agreeable decision, so there was no lingering animosity on those features at all. The city is really pleased with the university’s work on maintaining the heritage features.”\r\n\r\nSmith said he hopes the centre will boost tourism in the area.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got some really exciting plans for festivals and other functions happening within the Bader Centre,” Smith said\r\n\r\n<em>— With files from Katherine Fernandez-Blance</em>	Construction has begun on the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts, which is set to open its first stage in fall of 2013.	\N	t	f	Isabel Bader Centre 	f	2012-05-28 13:47:57-04	p	f	f
7770	Kingston FC makes franchise debut	Local team hopes to establish ties across the Eastern Ontario region	kingston-fc-makes-franchise-debut	7	325	\N	The Queen’s Gaels soccer team no longer plays at the highest level in Kingston. That title now lies with Kingston Football Club (Kingston FC), which competes in the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) against teams from across Ontario, as well as Montreal.\r\n\r\nManagement operates out of the nation’s capital, and the team practices there.\r\n\r\n“I understand it’s not ideal for the Kingston community or for me,” said former Gaels midfielder Jordan Brooks, who’s currently completing his master’s in biology at Queen’s and training with the team year-round. “I know it makes sense from a team and management perspective. I’m fine with it.”\r\n\r\nIt’s abnormal for any pro soccer team to practice two hours away from its home stadium, but Kingston FC is different.\r\n\r\nClub president and head coach Jimmy Hamrouni coached Ottawa’s Prospect FC from 2010 to 2011. Both Prospect FC and Ottawa’s Capital City FC, a first-division CSL team, folded in 2011. \r\n\r\nWithout an Ottawa team, Kingston was the next-best market  in Eastern Ontario. The construction of the Invista Centre’s artificial turf field coincided with Kingston FC’s arrival.\r\n\r\nMany players from Ottawa’s former teams lined up for Kingston FC, which fields a team in both CSL divisions.\r\n\r\nThe club operates out of Ottawa under Hamrouni, due to his previous experience in the league. Nearly all of the club’s players are from the Ottawa-Gatineau region. Only a small handful — led by Brooks — are not.\r\n\r\nAfter completing his fifth season as a Gael, Brooks signed a pro contract with Kingston FC two weeks ago.\r\n\r\n“At the moment I’m the only [Kingston native] on this team, but I think in the next few weeks that could easily change,” Brooks said.\r\n\r\nTwo players from Gananoque and two from Belleville are currently on the reserve team. With Brooks, they travel a long distance for practices — costs which are covered by the club.\r\n\r\nWhile the club may attract more players from across Eastern Ontario, the supporters will largely hail from Kingston. There were 700 fans at the home opener to witness a 4-2 loss to Toronto FC’s Academy. The following Saturday, 500 fans watched the team earn their first point in a 1-1 tie with the York Region Shooters.\r\n\r\n“The level of play is the third highest in Canada, behind the NASL and MLS, so this team’s still just improving,” Brooks said, adding the quality of play between the OUA and CSL is difficult to compare because it’s a different style of soccer.\r\n\r\n“[The OUA]’s not a technical league — it’s a physical, athletic one, not often pretty to watch,” he said.\r\n\r\nChairman of the club Lorne Abugov said the team has long-term plans in place.\r\n\r\n“We’re looking to build this into more of a regional team, and affiliate ourselves with local clubs from all over,” Abugov said. “Across the region we’re building an informal soccer bridge.”\r\n\r\nAbugov said expanding the region means there will be a greater quantity of higher-caliber players.\r\n\r\n“It’s our objective absolutely to find as many players from the area as we can,” Abugov said.\r\n\r\nOften referred to as a hockey city, Kingston’s soccer fans have thus far filled the bleachers at the Invista Centre.\r\n\r\nAbugov said the team has performed well for these crowds, but there is still much work to be done.\r\n\r\nKingston FC lost its third game 5-0 at home to the Windsor Stars and remains winless.\r\n\r\n“Rome wasn’t built in a day, so you know it takes time.”	The Queen’s Gaels soccer team no longer plays at the highest level in Kingston.

7765	Senate approves first-year residence in JDUC	Grad student spaces will be relocated to Confederation Place Hotel to make room for 98 undergraduate students	senate-approves-first-year-residence-jduc	1	325	\N	As a result of increased undergraduate enrollment, 98 first-year students will move into the JDUC in September after plans to turn the building’s graduate spaces into undergraduate rooms were approved.\r\n\r\nIn April Senate recognized the two per cent increase in applications to Queen’s for September 2012. This information called for an increase in enrollment resulting in the recommendation to add 146 new undergraduate residence spaces.\r\n\r\nThe residence spaces in the John Deutsch University Centre (JDUC) are comprised mainly of single rooms.\r\n\r\nBruce Griffiths, director of Queen’s housing and hospitality services, said the decision was necessary to combat growing numbers of students.\r\n\r\n“There was the desire to have increased enrollment but we guarantee all first-year students residence,” Griffiths said, adding that until the motion passed, the University was unsure if increased enrollment would be possible.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the 146 new spaces will be in Waldron Tower, where 48 additional spaces have been created following an expansion project that began in March.\r\n\r\nThe spaces that were in the JDUC for graduate students are being moved to the Confederation Place Hotel. The hotel approached the University with the idea of housing students.\r\n\r\n“The hotel reached out to us some months ago. They were looking for a different business model,” Griffiths said.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation Place Hotel previously offered overnight accommodations to grad students for several months at a time.  This arrangement was especially useful to students who needed to be in Kingston for a shorter time period than most leases allow, like four or five months, Griffiths said.  \r\n\r\nClaire Wenngren, MA ’11 lived in the JDUC from Sept. 2009 to April 2011.\r\n\r\n“As far as convenience goes, the JDUC can’t be beat, especially for people like me who want to use the athletic facilities without schlepping a lot of clothing and gear through the city,” she told the <em>Journal </em>via email.“Undergrads could probably also profit from living at the JDUC and being so close to these numerous facilities.”\r\n\r\nWenngren said there were also disadvantages to living in the JDUC, including little ventilation in the rooms and the proximity to campus pubs.\r\n\r\n“Where I lived, it was generally quiet, but I know people who lived above the Queen’s Pub [and] complained about the smell.”\r\n\r\n<em>— With files from Holly Tousignant</em>\r\n\r\n	As a result of increased undergraduate enrollment, 98 first-year students will move into the JDUC in September after plans to turn the building’s graduate spaces into undergraduate rooms were approved.\r\n	\N	t	f	Residence, enrollment, JDUC	t	2012-05-28 14:51:04-04	p	t	t
7760	Possible fall 2013 reunion in the works 	University leaders will discuss remodelling alumni reunions, Woolf says 	possible-fall-2013-reunion-works	1	325	\N	Conversations about Homecoming’s future are in the works after University Council voted to recommend Principal Daniel Woolf reinstate the event next year.\r\n\r\nThe motion called for Woolf to restore Homecoming for fall 2013, rather than in 2014 as initially planned. The motion passed at University Council on May 5 with approximately 130 council members in favour, three against and seven abstentions.\r\n\r\nWith the return of the annual reunion in sight, students and Kingstonians have voiced differing views on how the University should handle the event.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, the University announced Woolf’s intention to create a dialogue between student leaders, city representatives and other members of the Queen’s community about remodeling alumni reunions.\r\n\r\n“We’ve actually been working on this for some time,” Woolf told the <em>Journal</em> earlier this month. “Consultation has taken place at a preliminary level with [students] and we’ve touched base with the city.”\r\n\r\nHe added that Homecoming could be rebranded if it’s to return in 2013. Woolf declined to comment on the details of the remodeling.\r\n\r\n“Ultimately this is not a University decision,” he said. “The decision rests with me as it did four years ago when the original decision was made and I would prefer some discretion on the subject.”\r\n\r\nRector Nick Francis said discussions on developing a plan for a safe and fun fall reunion began in March at President’s Caucus, which is comprised of the president of each faculty society.\r\n\r\n“These discussions were really just a sounding board for ideas,” Francis, ArtSci’13 said. “I opened it up and asked them what they think needs to be addressed and how they think they should solve the issue of a massive street party that goes off the wire.”\r\n\r\nFollowing Homecoming 2008, the event was cancelled for two years by then-Principal Tom Williams. In 2010, Woolf extended the cancellation for an additional three years until 2014.\r\n\r\nAccording to Francis, the faculty society presidents were wary of the Aberdeen street party returning if Homecoming were restored.\r\n\r\n“[They] talked about how it’s not good for anybody, it’s not safe, specifically an unsupervised massive street party,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe said the plan to reinstate a fall reunion is being taken seriously because of the strong alumni support for its return.\r\n\r\n“The whole tradition needs to be revitalized,” he said. “There are compromises that have to be made. In order to safely restore and revitalize it we’re going to have to do it differently.”\r\n\r\nSave Our Neighbourhood Action Group (SONAG) creator Don Rogers said he thinks there needs to be stronger policing at the event in order to make it safe for students and alumni. SONAG is comprised of Kingston residents “who are fed up with the unacceptable behaviour of many Queen’s students,” according to their website.\r\n\r\n“A large part of the responsibility lies with the police,” Rogers said. “If they are more consistent [than] they had been in past years by issuing tickets they’d be able to control the minority that push the limits”\r\n\r\nRogers has lived in his Sydenham District home since 1979. He said Homecoming celebrations in the 1990s were calmer than it was in the 2000s, due to what he sees as greater control and organization.\r\n\r\n“To be able to get back to having a safe Homecoming we need to explore ways to control that small minority that causes these problems,” he said.\r\n\r\nKingston Mayor Mark Gerretsen said he’s spoken with Principal Woolf about making Homecoming a safer event in the future.\r\n\r\n“What needs to happen is that the city and the police have to work collaboratively with the University so that we can minimize the impact that the Aberdeen situation has with the taxpayers.”\r\n\r\nHe added that along with Queen’s alumni relations, the city of Kingston has suffered economically since Homecoming was banned in 2008.\r\n\r\n“It’s affected tourism into the city and with that comes effects on hotels, restaurants, businesses in the downtown area and the spin-off effects that all those have,” he said. “However, at the same time, we’ve benefited because we don’t have to spend upward [of] $400,000 or $500,000 on having to police the event.”\r\n\r\n	Conversations about Homecoming’s future are in the works after University Council voted to recommend Principal Daniel Woolf reinstate the event next year.	\N	t	f	Homecoming, Principal Woolf, Mark Gerretsen, SONAG	f	2012-05-28 13:51:48-04	p	f	f
7762	Students accuse public agency of misconduct	Queen's researchers allege agency published report they authored with unauthorized changes	students-accuse-public-agency-misconduct	1	325	\N	An Ontario government agency was accused of academic misconduct last month after two Queen’s graduate students claimed a report they authored appeared on the agency’s website containing changes they hadn’t agreed to.\r\n\r\nJennifer Massey and Sean Field filed a complaint with the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO), the body that commissioned Queen’s to produce a report on the effectiveness of supplemental instruction, an academic support model that uses peer-assisted study meetings to improve learning.\r\n\r\nThe University hired former Queen’s PhD candidate Jennifer Massey as lead investigator on a $44,633 contract.  Fellow geography PhD student Sean Field and former MA candidate Jeff Burrow were brought on to assist Massey.\r\n\r\nHEQCO, an agency of the Ontario government, conducts and commissions research on issues relating to post-secondary education in the province.\r\n\r\nOn April 27, the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations (OCUFA), a group that represents faculty and academic librarians across the province, released a statement on their website condemning HEQCO’s actions. While not illegal, HEQCO’s actions were unethical, the statement reads.\r\n\r\nQueen’s Senators Jordan Morelli, Terry Bridges and Mark Jones submitted three separate motions to Senate regarding the conflict. The motions called for Senate to endorse OCUFA’s statements about the incident, among other things.  The Agenda Committee rejected the proposals to include the motions on the Senate agenda for May 22.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Queen’s Senate Faculty Caucus blog, the committee rejected the motions because they believed OCUFA’s statements were “not factually correct.” \r\n\r\nMassey and Field’s letters to HEQCO president Harvey Weingarten, which are available to view on the Canadian Federation of Students’ (CFS) website, outline their concerns with the published report. CFS aims to provide a voice to students and represent their interests to federal and provincial governments.\r\n\r\nIn their letters, they claim a section of their report, which was critical of supplemental instruction, was removed from the final report, and that text was added that was in opposition to their conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe authors had previously refused to add suggested changes which were later included in the final report. Both the original and the altered reports are available on OCUFA’s website.\r\n\r\nThey also took issue with the published report’s disclaimer, which stated that the report solely reflected that of its authors.\r\n\r\n“We realized that what was posted was different than what we had submitted,” Field said.  \r\n\r\nMassey and Field requested the report be removed from the HEQCO’s website and replaced with their original submission. They also requested an apology from HEQCO.\r\n\r\nThe report was due to HEQCO in June 2010 Jennifer Massey submitted the report in December of that year. Jennifer Massey sent a report to HEQCO in June 2011. The report had already been through several rounds of edits at that point.\r\n\r\nWeingarten said HEQCO made revisions to the report after failing to hear back from Massey.\r\n\r\n“We felt the June 2011 report needed some edits and needed some changes,” he said.  “By September we had not heard back from [Massey] and our attempts to deal with the principal investigator, well, we couldn’t deal with her because she went AWOL.” \r\n\r\nWeingarten said HEQCO then approached Queen’s Vice-Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Ann Tierney with two options: either Queen’s abandon the project and not receive their final payment of $22,500 or have other staff at Queen’s finish the report.\r\n\r\nThe University chose the second option, and Chris Conway, director of the Office of Institutional Research and Planning, submitted a final report in Dec. 2011.\r\n\r\nOCUFA president and Queen’s librarian Constance Adamson said she thinks Queen’s didn’t protect the academic freedom of their researchers.\r\n\r\n“They probably should have done more to ensure that they understood what the terms of the contract meant,” she said.\r\n\r\nAdamson said OCUFA has called for Queen’s to do an investigation and for the Government of Ontario to look at HEQCO’s research practices. No such investigation has yet been announced.\r\n\r\nProvost Alan Harrison said he thinks it's unfortunate OCUFA didn’t inform Queen’s what they were going to post online before they posted it.\r\n\r\n“Had they done so, we would have pointed out some substantial factual inaccuracies,” he said. “One of those factual inaccuracies was characterizing Jennifer Massey as someone who was doing this work as a grad student, when in fact she was doing it as an employee of the University.” \r\n\r\nHarrison declined to comment on Massey and Field’s request for an apology from HEQCO.\r\n\r\n“It’s not anything to do with us,” Harrison said. “What they do or don’t do is entirely up to HEQCO.” 	An Ontario government agency was accused of academic misconduct last month after two Queen’s graduate students claimed a report they authored appeared on the agency’s website containing changes they hadn’t agreed to.	\N	t	f	Research, graduate students, misconduct 	f	2012-05-28 14:15:42-04	p	f	f

He also sees Queen’s becoming a leader in academic and non-academic support for at-risk students, such as those with mental illness or disabilities. \r\n\r\nIn the document, Woolf said he wants to see the division between main and West Campus erased as well as create new student residences and provide new forms of transportation like electric busses or trams to carry students between different areas of campus.\r\n\r\nFewer lecture hours and an increase in blended models of learning are also in Queen’s future, according to the document.\r\n\r\n<em>— Holly Tousignant</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>SMART awarded contract with the City</strong>\r\n\r\n A newly created AMS team has been chosen by the City of Kingston as a property standards bylaw contractor.\r\n\r\nThe Student Maintenance and Resource Team (SMART), run out of the Municipal Affairs Commission will contract students to clean properties in the student housing area that don’t meet city bylaw standards.\r\n\r\nThe city released a request for proposals (RFP) for contractors to cover property standards bylaws in the student neighborhood for a two-year term.\r\n\r\nSMART responded to the RFP, and the city chose them.\r\n\r\nThe city will direct SMART to clean properties when tenants have failed to respond appropriately to bylaw orders themselves.\r\n\r\nFees for the contracts will vary depending on the work performed.\r\n\r\nSMART students will also provide free clean-up and beautification services to students living near campus, as well as contract work for landlords.\r\n\r\n<em>— Holly Tousignant</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Charging station coming to Kingston</strong>\r\n\r\nKingston will soon have its first privately owned electric vehicle (EV) charging station, free of charge.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador Conference Resort, located on 1550 Princess Street, has partnered up with Sun Country Highway, a company that creates electric-vehicle infrastructure, to set up the station.  It will be completely accessible to the public.\r\n\r\nAn EV charging station supplies electric energy to hybrid and battery electric cars. While electric cars can be charged through a regular wall socket, charging stations have use special sensors to disconnect power when the vehicle is fully charged and allow for multiple users to charge at once.\r\n\r\nThese stations have been growing in popularity internationally and in Canada in recent years, with Sun Country Highway being one of the only companies to set up these stations nationally.\r\n\r\nThis will be the only Electric Vehicle station in a 400 km radius of Kingston.\r\n\r\nIn light of this recent announcement, the City of Kingston is now also looking installing public charging stations in the coming year.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, the City of Kingston passed a motion in city council to explore adding more stations in town.\r\n\r\n<em>- Joanna Plucinska</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Bird droppings reveal effect of insecticide</strong>\r\n\r\nBird droppings collected in an unused chimney on campus have provided clues about the declining population of the North American chimney swift, a small bird, according to Canadian researchers.\r\n\r\nThe six-feet-deep collection of excrement represents 50 years of bird droppings.

7772	Students deserve a genuine Homecoming		students-deserve-unaltered-return	13	325	\N	The University Council’s recent decision to recommend the restoration of Homecoming is long overdue. It indicates an important shift in the University’s treatment of its students.\r\n\r\nWoolf’s decision to extend Homecoming’s cancellation until 2014 in 2010 set a patronizing tone, sending a message to students that they weren’t to be trusted. Instead of trying to negotiate with students and community members off the bat, the University acted like a parent punishing a naughty child by indefinitely lengthening the postponement without engaging in any sort of negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt now rests in the hands of senior administrators and Principal Woolf to give the final go-ahead and decide on what the new Homecoming might look like or whether it will return at all.\r\n\r\nThe Council’s vote is a teaser to students who expect a return of the original Homecoming, but may instead get a rebranded, reworked and ultimately lacklustre version.\r\n\r\nRenaming the event ‘Fall Reunion’ is unlikely to change the way it’s seen by alumni. But, if the university’s senior administrators take stronger measures to mitigate the street party and the revelry surrounding the event, they may risk altogether eliminating the essence of Homecoming that is so well-loved and missed by students and alumni.\r\n\r\nThe administration needs to trust that students and alumni alike will realize the consequences of their actions and behave in an appropriate fashion during future homecomings.\r\n\r\nStudents shouldn’t have to be babied with a watered-down version of Homecoming — they deserve to have the most missed parts of the celebration such as the football game, the parade and the festivities surrounding the event restored.\r\n\r\nAlternatives to the street party, such as sanctioned events at Alfie’s, have the potential to be successful if marked appropriately. The University can also adopt previously used measures such as establishing safe drinking tents with volunteers on hand giving out water and red cups to prevent broken bottles to maintain a safe environment.\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether to follow the Council’s recommendation, and potentially reinstitute Homecoming, senior administrators should be mindful of what Homecoming means to students and alumni.\r\n\r\nWe’ll now encounter the first graduating class that has yet to experience a true homecoming. We’ve already endured a five-year wait — let’s make sure that the return of Homecoming means that the most important and beloved parts of the event aren’t forgotten.\r\n\r\n<em>— Journal Editorial Board</em>	The University Council’s recent decision to recommend the restoration of Homecoming is long overdue.

7782	Love from far away	Long-distance couples focus on communication	love-far-away	5	325	\N	There are few things as sweet as the airport reunion. With couples reuniting everywhere, one must remember that the long-distance relationship was around long before the first airplane was constructed.\r\n\r\nWhen Romantic era poet John Keats died of tuberculosis in 1821, he was over 1000 miles away from his lover and fiancée Fanny Brawne. Forced apart for most of their relationship, the couple corresponded by letter.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times, soldiers stationed overseas use modern technology, like email or Skype, to stay in touch with their other halves.\r\n\r\nWith the onset of the summer months, Queen’s students will also forcibly succumb to months apart from their significant others.\r\n\r\nFor Hannah May and Aidan Payne, this past year may have been the last time they shared an area code.\r\n\r\nWhen the couple began dating in early 2011, it hadn’t yet occurred to them that, the following summer, they might be trying a long distance relationship.\r\n\r\n“You have those love goggles where you don’t see anything wrong [and] don’t see that anything could [go] wrong,” Payne, ArtSci ’12, said. “And then at some point Hannah turned to me in the car and said we need to talk about us not seeing each other for months on end.”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t the last time the two would try long distance. Following Payne’s graduation this past April, he will be moving back to Boston, MA indefinitely.\r\n\r\nMay said Payne’s absence this year will bring changes to her day-to-day life.\r\n\r\n“For the past year and a half, he’s been a major part of my life here at Queen’s,” she said. “It’s going to be weird and definitely an adjustment to not have him there at school with me, and not nearby — I’m just going to miss him.”\r\n\r\nThe couple doesn’t plan to break up anytime soon.\r\n\r\n“He’s the best boyfriend,” May said. “He’s so thoughtful — the craziest, the funniest. I’m never bored.”\r\n\r\nAlthough May, ArtSci ’13 is remaining in Kingston come September, the couple doesn’t yet know if their separation will be permanent.\r\n\r\n“We’ve talked about it,” Payne said. “I’m working in the film industry and so I can go between the two, but I’m not a citizen of Canada yet.”\r\n\r\nWhile May is considering moving to the States in the future, she must endure the year without her boyfriend.\r\n\r\n“I can’t just up and move,” she said. “Obviously if I could, I would.”\r\n\r\nPayne said he plans to visit Canada as much as possible in the coming year.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been trying to get film shoots in the Toronto area so that I can come up here on business-related reasons and then hop over to Kingston on my way back home,” he said. “That way I could see her for a bit and not lose money in the process.”\r\n\r\nTo compensate for time spent apart during the summer and school year, Payne and May said they will meet in New York City.\r\n\r\nFor most of the year, however, over 850 km will separate the couple. They plan to call and Skype as often as possible.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the timing doesn’t work out in the day,” May said. “But sometimes a short phone call or Skype call goes a long way.”\r\n\r\n“We are getting an international texting plan,” Payne added.\r\n\r\n“That’s romantic,” May said. “That’s like new media love.”\r\n\r\nThe couple agree that the long distance effort will be worth it in the end.\r\n\r\n“There’s no one quite like Hannah,” Payne said. “I’ll go through whatever we need to go through in order to have her at the other side.”\r\n\r\nTo help their love thrive, long — distance couples can take an extra step and try alternative forms of communication.\r\n\r\nEnglish professor Mark Jones said love letters are an old-fashioned but effective way of keeping the intimacy alive.\r\n\r\nWhen Keats was kept in isolation because of his illness, he and Brawne would exchange brief, undated letters from different sides of the duplex house where they lived. According to Jones, this was their version of today’s modern forms of communication.\r\n\r\n“The same dynamics are going to apply, no matter what medium you’ve got,” he said. “You’re still going to have some form of communication that is … abridging distance.”\r\n\r\nWhile love letters stand as a reminder of the distance between a couple, Jones said they also help bring them closer together.\r\n\r\n“There’s incredible intimacy — maybe some things you can’t tell someone face to face,” he said.\r\n\r\nWhile letter-writing is effective in long-distance relationships, Jane Sherwood, a Kingston-based couples counsellor, said that prolonged time apart can bring on an unnaturally long ‘honeymoon phase.’\r\n\r\nShe said couples who spend the majority of their time apart risk remaining in this stage longer than normal.\r\n\r\n “You never have to go through the drudgery of everyday life, like dividing household chores and paying bills,” she said. “They may always have a great time when they’re together and they visit and then they go home to face all those issues on their own.”\r\n\r\nThe problem here, according to Sherwood, is that these couples may move too quickly into high-commitment situations like marriage.\r\n\r\n“So the problem is … jumping too far ahead in the relationship too quickly because everything’s so rosy,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Take some time to maybe live together or do some counseling together to discover where you’re at in terms of compatibility.”\r\n\r\nCouples who are aware of an impending long-distance separation should come up with a plan, she said.\r\n\r\n“It should be tailor-made to each individual couple,” she said. “Each couple should sit down and communicate clearly what their expectations are.”\r\n\r\nIn her own sessions, Sherwood said similar issues come up with long-distance couples.\r\n\r\nShe said that couples typically face issues around trust, expectations and a lack of communication, among other issues.\r\n\r\nAccording to her, students make up a high amount of long-distance relationships due to summer separation.\r\n\r\nSherwood said student couples who live apart, but attend the same school, don’t have the same issues to worry about.\r\n\r\n“They’re involved in all the nitty gritty of each other’s lives,” she said. “If they’re in daily contact, then I think they would move out of the honeymoon phase.”\r\n\r\nSo how do long-distance couples keep an intimate relationship together?\r\n\r\n“I think visiting as often as possible definitely would be number one,” she said, adding that telephone and Skype contact should be done as often as possible.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to know, however, that one half of the couple will occasionally put other commitments, like work, school and family ahead of their significant other, Sherwood said.\r\n\r\n“Don’t expect perfection during distance with each other,” Sherwood said. “Expectations can get too high; I think you need to keep a perspective that this isn’t going to be perfect.” 	There are few things as sweet as the airport reunion.	\N	t	f	Relationships, long-distance	t	2012-05-28 21:37:14-04	p	f	f
7761	Faculty Board proposes accelerated medical school 	Program would be first of its kind in North America	faculty-board-proposed-accelerated-medical-school	1	325	\N	If a proposed new program passes at Senate, select students could proceed to medical school at Queen’s after only two years of undergraduate education.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for the accelerated program was approved by Arts and Science Faculty Board on May 4.\r\n\r\nThe program is the brainchild of Dr. Richard Reznick, dean of Health Sciences and director of the Queen’s School of Medicine.\r\n\r\n“One of our strategic priorities in the School of Medicine is to explore innovative models of medical education,” Reznick told the <em>Journal </em>via email.\r\n\r\nThe proposal must pass through Senate before it can become official.\r\n\r\nThe next Senate meeting will be held on Sept. 25.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposal, 10 gifted high school students will be selected to take part in the Accelerated Pathway to Medical School at Queen’s each year. The program, which is slated to begin in 2013, will enable them to complete the degree requirements for a Doctor of Medicine, including undergraduate education, in six years, instead of the traditional eight.\r\n\r\n“A review of the education of physicians in many other countries, including most of Europe and many parts of Asia suggested that a shorter time frame might be feasible,” Reznick said.\r\n\r\nQueen’s will be the first university in Canada to implement such a program, Physiology professor Ken Rose said. Rose was responsible for proposing the motion at Faculty Board.  \r\n\r\n“I’m really enamored with the idea of being the first,” Rose said.\r\n\r\nThe program could also allow students to proceed to medical school without taking the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT.)\r\n\r\n“Medical colleagues are becoming increasingly concerned about the closing of the socioeconomic gap of those taking the MCAT,” Rose said, adding that the test itself costs around $300 to 400, not including preparation courses.\r\n\r\nTo be considered for the program, students must be competitive candidates for the Chancellor’s scholarship, awarded to 50 new Queen’s students each year with an annual value of $9,000. Students must have an average of 90 per cent or above to be considered for the Chancellor’s Scholarship. High schools can nominate one to three students depending on the school.\r\n\r\nAround 50 to 60 students from the Chancellor scholarship candidate pool will be invited to Queen’s for an interview. Following the interview process, offers will be made to ten students.\r\n\r\nStudents will be required to take the standard five courses during the first two years, including 21.00 credits worth of mandatory classes, including BIOL 102, MATH 121, ENGL 100 and STATS 263.\r\n\r\nThe students will also be required to take part in laboratory and clinical internships and learning modules.\r\n\r\nThe program also involves using first and second year medical students as mentors as a way to immerse the 10 younger students in the School of Medicine.\r\n\r\n“The medical class at Queen’s is extremely cohesive and the ten other students have to be assimilated,” Rose said.\r\n\r\nJames Simpson, Aesculapian Society representative to the AMS, said he believes the program holds numerous pros and cons for students.\r\n\r\n“One of the most important features of Queen’s Medicine is the camaraderie within our class,” Simpson, Meds ’15, said. “It certainly is possible that bringing in a special group of students through a separate stream will damage this camaraderie to some extent.”\r\n\r\nSimpson said it’s important to note that accelerated systems have been successful in Europe, where students get into slightly longer medical programs straight out of high school, and in Quebec, where students can apply to enter medical school after two years in a public vocational college.\r\n\r\n“As far as I’m aware, there isn’t any evidence showing that these doctors are any worse than the rest of North American doctors, despite the fact that North American doctors probably have two to three years more undergraduate training on average,” Simpson said. “If this is true, then isn’t our system wasting money?”	If a proposed new program passes at Senate, select students could proceed to medical school at Queen’s after only two years of undergraduate education.	\N	t	f	Academics, medical school, Senate, Faculty Board	f	2012-05-28 13:57:40-04	p	t	t

After evaluating all my options, I decided that [Queen’s] was a good fit,” he said.\r\n\r\nTrivieri’s powerful running style and willingness to fight for extra yards should allow him to compete for a feature spot within a talented Queen’s backfield.\r\n\r\nLike all incoming rookies, Trivieri will be confronted by the faster pace and increased physicality of university football. Unlike most recruits, he will also have to readjust to the technical differences of the Canadian game following his season in Virginia.\r\n\r\n“I just want to come in, learn the system and work hard,” Trivieri said. “I plan on giving everything on the football field, and hopefully it works out.”\r\n\r\nThree of Trivieri’s former teammates at St. Michael’s College School are also part of the Gaels’ 2012 recruiting class:\r\n\r\n<strong>Max Townsend</strong>\r\n\r\nQuarterback Max Townsend was a two-time captain and team MVP at St. Michael’s.

7769	Aprile to the Blue Bombers	Gaels receiver drafted 16th overall	aprile-blue-bombers	7	325	\N	Just six years after playing his first football game, Gaels wide receiver Giovanni Aprile could be on his way to the pros. \r\n\r\nEarlier this month, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers selected Aprile with the 16th overall pick in the 3rd round of the 2012 CFL Draft.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Toronto, with only two years of high school football at Senator O’Connor College School behind him, Aprile suited up for one game in his first two seasons at Queen’s.\r\n\r\nHe secured a starting role in 2010, and enjoyed a stellar 2011 campaign that saw him emerge as a premier offensive threat in the CIS.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t really care where I went [in the draft],” said Aprile, who was ranked 12th in the CFL’s pre-draft rankings. “If I was drafted in the sixth round, that would have been sick.”\r\n\r\nAprile was the lone Gael chosen in the draft. Running back Ryan Granberg, offensive lineman Derek Morris and defensive lineman Frank Pankewich all attended the CFL evaluation camp in early March, but were not among the 45 players selected.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Bombers, who are coming off a 34-23 loss in the 2011 Grey Cup, expressed interest in shifting Aprile from receiver to safety, a position he hasn’t played since high school. At 6’3 and 213 pounds, Aprile is significantly bigger than any current Winnipeg defensive back.\r\n\r\n“[The Bombers] are going to try me out at a few different places because they’re looking for a more versatile player,” Aprile said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to starting at receiver, Aprile dominated on special teams in 2011 as the Gaels’ primary kick returner, leading the CIS with 36.5 yards per return and two touchdowns.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gaels head coach Pat Sheahan believes Aprile’s versatility will be a terrific asset at the professional level, his ability to adapt will depend on where the Bombers choose to deploy him on the field.\r\n\r\n“I believe this is kind of where potential meets opportunity,” Sheahan said. “Are they going to use him at [receiver]? If they do, then he’s got good grounding in that position, but if they like him as an athlete and want to use him somewhere else, then there will be a pretty steep learning curve.”\r\n\r\nAprile will attend training camp with the Bombers, which runs from the end of May until the start of the regular season on June 29. Players drafted to the CFL do not forego their CIS eligibility, so Aprile could return to Queen’s in 2012 in lieu of signing a professional contract.\r\n\r\n“I suppose Queen’s fans would not be disappointed to see him back for a little bit of a refresher. But he may impress and stay, you never know,” Sheahan said.\r\n\r\n	Just six years after playing his first football game, Gaels wide receiver Giovanni Aprile could be on his way to the pros. \r\n	\N	t	f	Football, Aprile, Blue Bombers	f	2012-05-28 15:42:34-04	p	f	f
7771	From the field to the Bachelor	Brad Smith and other former Gaels in the public sphere	field-bachelor	7	325	\N	Former Gaels wide receiver Brad Smith may be a free agent in the CFL, but if he plays his cards right, he won’t be a free agent on the love market for much longer.\r\n\r\nSmith has been chosen to star on the first season of The Bachelor Canada, which will air this fall on CityTV. Without a CFL team to play for in 2012, he’ll instead spend his spring surrounded by 25 eligible bachelorettes, passing out roses rather than receiving passes.\r\n\r\nThe executives of the show are aiming to attract viewers through Smith’s combination of charm and athleticism.\r\n\r\nOne of the top Gaels’ wide receivers of all-time, Smith graduated from Queen’s in 2007 after earning two CIS All-Canadian honours during his university career.\r\n\r\nHe was drafted 44th overall by the Toronto Argonauts in the 2007 CFL Draft, later playing for the Montreal Alouettes and the Edmonton Eskimos.\r\n\r\nWhile Smith’s career path is unconventional for a former CIS athlete, it’s not uncommon for Queen’s athletes to experience fame following their Gaels careers.\r\n\r\nInspired by Smith, here are four former Queen’s Gaels in the public eye:\r\n\r\n<strong>Mike Schad </strong>\r\n\r\nAn ex-Gael offensive lineman who enjoyed the football spotlight in the U.S. rather than in Canada. The big man from Belleville, Ont. is the only player in CIS history to be selected in the first round of the NFL draft. Schad was selected 23rd overall by the L.A. Rams in 1986, where he played from 1987-88. He was then traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, where he retired in 1993. Over his career, Schad played in 62 NFL games for the Rams and Eagles.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rod Smith </strong>\r\n\r\nThe TSN sportscaster played offensive guard for the Queen’s football team in the late 1970s. The anchor of the weeknight edition of SportsCentre, Smith joined the Gaels in 1979, a year after Queen’s clinched its second Vanier Cup championship. Smith joined TSN in 1987 and has been a mainstay on SportsCentre since 1995, previously serving as a play-by-play announcer for the CFL on TSN and several CIS championship games.\r\n\r\n<strong>Jock Climie</strong>\r\n\r\nThe CFL on TSN studio analyst starred as a receiver for Queen’s in the late 1980s. In 1988, Climie set the CIS single-season record for receiving yards with 1,091. A member of the Queen’s Football Hall of Fame, Climie played 12 seasons in the CFL, earning his law degree from Queen’s over the course of six winter semesters and off-seasons. A practicing lawyer, Climie joined TSN as a football analyst following his retirement in 2001.\r\n\r\n<strong>Kate McKenna</strong>\r\n\r\nFormer Queen’s goalkeeper currently works for the CFL as an online host and content producer. McKenna played for the Gaels’ women’s soccer team and graudated from Queen’s Concurrent Education program in 2008. She has previously worked for TSN, CBC Sports and the Hamilton Spectator. and served as the host of Ticats TV for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats during the 2010 CFL season.\r\n\r\n<em>— Nick Faris and Peter Morrow</em>	Former Gaels wide receiver Brad Smith has been chosen to star on the first season of The Bachelor Canada.

7774	More than money		more-money	13	325	\N	When fourth-year hit, I found some of my most intelligent and capable friends expressing increasing uncertainty about their futures. As the end of exams approached, they doubted whether their decision to write essays and read novels for four years as ArtSci ’12s was indeed a sound one.\r\n\r\nWe’re bombarded with statistics about high unemployment rates for new graduates, especially for those equipped with Arts degrees, explaining my friends’ fears.\r\n\r\nAs recent articles in Maclean’s and Canadian Business magazines announced, the best jobs are to be found in the oil fields of Alberta. This is because, according to Canadian Business magazine, employment for oil engineers has increased by 85 per cent between 2006 and 2011, with some of the highest starting salaries in the country.\r\n\r\nWith students graduating with large debts and limited job prospects, guaranteed employment and large salaries are undeniably very attractive.\r\n\r\nBut can a good job really be defined solely by money and guarantee of work?\r\n\r\nI’d like to borrow an idea from David Ricardo's concept of comparative advantage, a theory that outlines how an economy should specialize in what they can produce most efficiently and cheaply.  It’s an idea that’s meant to increase productivity in an economy — an idea that should also be transferred to how young people pick careers and university degrees.\r\n\r\nThe reason I didn’t pursue a degree in engineering was because I’m no good with math, chemistry or physics and quite frankly, I have very little interest in the field. Even if I were to become an oil engineer, I probably wouldn’t make a very good one and I certainly wouldn’t enjoy going to work every day.\r\n\r\nPeople should be working in jobs that they have a comparative advantage in, meaning jobs that they are both good at and that they enjoy.\r\n\r\nThere’s no way to define what the best job is, but, there is such a thing as the best job for you. Ultimately, people shouldn’t sacrifice their talents and sanity for the sake of financial security.\r\n\r\nWhile this idea may seem idealistic, especially with the current economic climate, I still believe that people should find their economic niche in which they can capitalize on their talents, and thus, maximize what they give back to society.\r\n\r\n<strong>This editorial has been updated to reflect the following clarification: David Ricardo theorized the concept of comparative advantage. </strong>	There’s no way to define what the best job is, but, there is such a thing as the best job for you. Ultimately, people shouldn’t sacrifice their talents and sanity for the sake of financial security.\r\n	\N	t	t	Signed editorial 	f	2012-05-28 16:32:14-04	p	t	t
7777	Sweet Jets take off 	Queen's garage pop trio releases first EP 'Noise Candy' 	sweet-jets-take	3	325	\N	When Kingston’s Sweet Jets started out playing house parties, they had no idea they would be recording an EP just a year later.\r\n\r\nGuitarist and vocalist Colin Robinson, bassist James Gagne and drummer Paul Dyck released ‘Noise Candy’ on April 1.\r\n\r\nAlthough they’ve only been together for a short time, Dyck, ArtSci ’13, recalls their misfortune while playing in a restaurant in Toronto, which had just been on the show <em>Restaurant Makeover</em>.\r\n\r\n“A pipe exploded on the floor above us midway through our set and the ceiling just started dripping serious amounts of water all over the bar — it was pretty epic.”\r\n\r\nThe band recorded the EP this spring in their friend’s basement.\r\n\r\nThey decided to make their album available online for free download.\r\n\r\n“Right now we’re just trying to get exposure — we’d rather have people download it now than have people not listen to it because they didn’t have the money to pay.”\r\n\r\nThe band originally started playing with only Paul on drums and Colin on guitar in January 2011, later adding bassist James in October.\r\n\r\n“James can lay down the groove with the bass and drive the song instead of just relying on fast guitar hooks,” Dyck said.\r\n\r\nThe EP contains all original songs written by the band.\r\n\r\n“One of our most popular songs is ‘Wish I’. It was the dark horse of the album. We didn’t think people would like it as much as they do.” \r\n\r\nSweet Jets have played several shows at the Mansion and Clark Hall Pub in the past and have come a long way since their early days.\r\n\r\n“We played in my basement for a bit, and then we moved into James’ basement. Now we’ve moved up to the main floor in Colin’s house. This is actually a big step up,” Dyck said.\r\n\r\nWhile the group is in the midst of balancing band activities with personal pursuits, they show no signs of slowing down.\r\n\r\n“We’re looking to record an A side/B side, duo release, just two songs, hopefully this month, and then work on new stuff for the rest of the summer,” Dyck said.\r\n\r\n<em>— With files from Savoula Stylianou</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sweet Jets’ debut EP is available for free download at sweetjets.bandcamp.com.</strong>\r\n\r\n	When Kingston’s Sweet Jets started out playing house parties, they had no idea they would be recording an EP just a year later.	\N	t	f	Interview, Sweet Jets 	f	2012-05-28 16:55:14-04	p	t	t

189	195	Letter of Apology	The purpose of this letter is to clarify the Journal’s position regarding the dart given on the editorials page of the Apr, 2 edition of the Journal to Stephanie St. Clair for her conduct at the John Orr dinner.  I would first like to apologize for perpetuating false accusations against Ms. St. Clair.  I had no proof she threw a glass of wine at an alumnus and printed the misinformation based on hearsay.  It was unacceptable and goes against this newspaper’s ongoing commitment to strong and accurate reporting.  For this I am truly sorry.<br>\r\nThe Journal stands by its criticism of Ms. St. Clair’s behaviour at that event in dealing with a conflict between an alumni and a fellow AMS representative.  She acted unprofessionally and her conduct led to her being asked to leave the event.  This was a poor manner in which to represent Queen’s students.\r\n \r\nErin Flegg\r\nEditor in Chief, Vol. 136	85
